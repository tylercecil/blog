I have a puzzle for you: **when would use him/her/them vs
himself/herself/themselves? Can you ever swap one out for the other?**

> Got an answer in your head? Cool!

In this post, I hope to break whatever answer you came up with, and replace it
with a surprising yet simple answer! You'll laugh. You'll cry. And maybe...
just maybe, you'll learn yourself something.

Definitions
===========

First, let's define some terms. For our purposes there are three types of noun
phrases:

R-Expression
: Referse to something specific or concrete.[^ref]\
    *i.e.* "The cat", "Tom", "My hopes and dreams"

Pronoun
: May (or may not) refere to another NP in the sentence (or discourse).\
    *i.e.* he/him, she/her, they/them

Anaphor[^ana]
: *Must* refere to another NP in the sentence.\
    *i.e.* himself, herself, themselves

[^ref]: [Well, kinda](/posts/2020-02-13-reference.html)... but that's not the
  point right now!
[^ana]: I've used the word anaphor in my post on [Winograd
  schema](/posts/2020-03-10-b-winograd.html). I have to admit, I think I may
  have been using it incorrectly / confusingly. Consider this an updated
  definition.

Here's an example to make that a bit more concrete. We'll use an index to mark
what each NP is referring to.

(@) [Jeremy]{.i} fooled [himself]{.i} into thinking [he]{.ij} could love
  another man.

NP        Type         Index
--------- ------------ -----------
"Jeremy"  R-Expression $i$
"himself" Anaphor      $i$
"he"      Pronoun      $i$ or $j$

Note how "he" could refer to Jeremy (likely how you read it without context),
*or* it could refer to some other man, like Kyle!

(@) [Jeremy]{.i} fooled [himself]{.i} into thinking [Kyle]{.j} could love
  another man.

It's that flexibility that makes "he" a pronoun, and not an anaphor. Similarly,
because "himself" can only share an index with "Jeremy", it is an anaphor.

So, let me phrase our riddle a bit more exactly: **what rule syntactically
governs the distribution[^dist] of pronouns and anaphora?**

(@) [Roberto]{.i} taught [himself]{.i} to fly.
(@) [Roberto]{.i} taught [him]{.j} to fly.
(@) [[Roberto]{.i} taught [himself]{.j} to fly.]{.bad}
(@) [[Roberto]{.i} taught [him]{.i} to fly.]{.bad}
(@) [[Himself]{.i} taught [Robert]{.i} to fly.]{.bad}
(@) [He]{.i} taught [Robert]{.j} to fly.
(@) [[He]{.i} taught [Robert]{.i} to fly.]{.bad}

[^dist]: "Governs the distribution" might sound a bit technical, but it's
  nothing special. The "distribution" of a class of words defines, syntactically,
  where they occur. For example, "adjectives are placed before nouns".
