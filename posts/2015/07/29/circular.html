      <h1>Circular Programming</h1>

    <article>
      <p>Remember how you felt the first time you saw a recursive
      function? Today I was reminded… My mentor at LANL (a true
      functional guru) wrote a bit of code using what he called
      “circular programming.” He, of course, figured it was no big deal,
      but it was more than my feeble little mind could take. Based on <a
      href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29226483/circular-programming-replace-list-elements-by-minimum-value">this</a>
      Stack Overflow post, I made this little run-through on what’s
      going on, in order to test my own understanding.</p>
      <h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
      <p>Let’s say I want to replace every element of a list with the
      minimum element of that list. The naive approach is to pass the
      list twice: once to find the minimum element, and another to
      replace every value with it. (Obviously there are better ways to
      do this, but bear with me… I want to start with an easy
      example).</p>
      <p>How might we go about this with a single pass? If we were in C,
      the answer would be fairly simple (provided our list was an array
      of pointers to our elements): replace every pointer with a pointer
      to a common element, and store the minimum element in this common
      placeholder. I will show you a way in Haskell, using a very clever
      (and possibly existentially terrifying) trick called <a
      href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Circular_programming">Circular
      Programming</a>. Despite what some parts of the Internet will have
      you think, this has almost nothing to do with Arrows, so don’t
      worry. However it is conceptually identical to <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style">continuation
      passing style</a>.</p>
      <h2 id="two-functions-one-magic-trick">Two Functions, One Magic
      Trick</h2>
      <p>We start off with the magic… Try reading through this
      function.</p>
      <h4 id="trace"><code>trace</code></h4>
      <div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
      class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ot">trace ::</span> (a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> c <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> (b, c)) <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> b</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>trace f a <span class="ot">=</span> b</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="kw">where</span> (b, c) <span class="ot">=</span> f a c</span></code></pre></div>
      <p>Do you feel uneasy? Let’s take a look at this where clause…
      <code>where (b, c) = f a c</code>. So we are saying that
      <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> are return values of
      <code>f</code> when <code>f</code> is applied to <code>a</code>
      and <code>c</code>. <code>c</code> is both a return value and a
      parameter of the function <code>f</code>! At first glance this
      might seem like a time travel paradox!</p>
      <p>We’ll get back to this, but the hint for why this is possible
      is lazy evaluation. Don’t feel bad if this doesn’t make sense yet
      — we’re going to keep exploring</p>
      <h4 id="repminlist"><code>repminList'</code></h4>
      <div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
      class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ot">repminList&#39; ::</span> (<span class="dt">Ord</span> a) <span class="ot">=&gt;</span> [a] <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> a <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> ([a], a)</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>repminList&#39; [x] m <span class="ot">=</span> ([m], x)</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>repminList&#39; (x<span class="op">:</span>xs) m <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="kw">let</span> (replaced, m&#39;) <span class="ot">=</span> repminList&#39; xs m</span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>                       <span class="kw">in</span> (m <span class="op">:</span> replaced, <span class="fu">min</span> x m&#39;)</span></code></pre></div>
      <p>Next we have <code>repminList'</code>, which is actually doing
      the work. This function should be fairly understandable. The
      function gets a list <code>xs</code> and an element
      <code>m</code>, and returns a tuple. The first element is the list
      <code>xs</code> with every element replaced with <code>m</code>.
      The second element is the minimum element of <code>xs</code>.</p>
      <p>Running in <code>ghci</code>:</p>
      <pre><code> *Main&gt; repminList&#39; [1..10] 0
 ([0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], 1)</code></pre>
      <p>See, I’m not lying!</p>
      <h4 id="repminlist-1"><code>repminList</code></h4>
      <div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre
      class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="ot">repminList ::</span> (<span class="dt">Ord</span> a) <span class="ot">=&gt;</span> [a] <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> [a]</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>repminList <span class="ot">=</span> trace repminList&#39;</span></code></pre></div>
      <p>Finally <code>repminList</code> performs our task for us, by
      using our magical function <code>trace</code> and applying it to
      <code>repminList'</code>. Again, running in <code>ghci</code> we
      find:</p>
      <pre><code>*Main&gt; repminList [1..10]
 [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
</code></pre>
      <p>Ok. Think things over a bit, and see if you can understand how
      the system as a whole is working. Remember: the secret is lazy
      evaluation.</p>
      <h2 id="call-by-need">Call-by-Need</h2>
      <p>Some people seem to think of lazy evaluation as “Oh, the user
      needs the return value! Go run the function!” But what does it
      mean to “run a function” in Haskell? In lambda calculus we do not
      “run” lambda abstractions — we take applications, and apply
      \(\beta\)-reductions. \[ (x . T) :: y T[x := y] \] Of course, one
      can use a number of different reduction strategies in lambda
      calculus (e.g. full reduction, normal order, call-by-value, …);
      Haskell uses what’s known as <a
      href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/need-journal/need-journal.ps">call-by-need</a>.
      In this evaluation strategy, an idea of aliasing is employed. So
      for any lambda term \(T\), applications such as \[ (x . x : x) ::
      T T_1 : T_2 \] result in \(T_1\) and \(T_2\) “referring” to the
      same value. So if at any reduction step \(T_1 T’\), then \(T_2
      T’\) occurs at the same step. Call-by-need (or lazy-execution) is
      essentially creating a graph of how all names depend on each
      other. Typically, we call the vertices of this graph <a
      href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Thunk">thunks</a>. In Haskell each
      thunk knows its type, what data constructor created it, and the
      thunks of its components. Conceptually, Haskell definitions are
      creating an <em>abstract syntax graph</em> (as opposed to a tree);
      computations are traversals and reductions of this graph.
      (<em>Note that I necessarily don’t mean this literally; I am no
      ghc expert, and could not tell you exactly what’s going on in the
      inner workings of Haskell. I simply mean conceptually.</em>)</p>
      <h4 id="an-example">An Example</h4>
      <p>Let’s say we have <code>xs = [1, 2, 3]</code>. The <em>ASG</em>
      will look something like this:</p>
      <p><img src="/images/posts/circ/list_thunk.svg" width="100%"></p>
      <p>So when we ask for the first element of a list <code>xs</code>
      in Haskell, this is what really happens:</p>
      <ol type="1">
      <li>Inspect the <code>xs</code> thunk, and see what data
      constructor made it.</li>
      <li>Hopefully <code>xs</code> was constructed with the
      <code>(:)</code> constructor. The only other list constructor is
      <code>[]</code>, which contains references to no other
      thunks.</li>
      <li>The <code>(:)</code> refers to two other thunks: the
      <code>head</code> and the <code>tail</code>.</li>
      <li>We can then return a reference to the head thunk.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>So in order to calculate <code>head xs</code>, we only needed
      to “evaluate” two nodes: the list constructor, and its head.
      Consider if <code>xs = [1, undefined, undefined]</code>.
      <code>head xs</code> in this case would return the same result,
      even though there are undefined thunks in our <em>ASG</em>. In
      Haskell we can define even more bizarre structures. For instance,
      a typical representation of a term with type <a
      href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Bottom">\(\)</a> is
      <code>let bot = bot</code>.</p>
      <p><img src="/images/posts/circ/bot.svg" width="25%" style="margin-left:37.5%;"></p>
      <p>If we ever want to evaluate <code>bot</code>, first
      <code>bot</code> must be evaluated. Therefore, if we were to ask
      for this value, our code will hang. Lazy execution is what lets us
      do dirty things like this. In general, whenever we have a cycle
      like this, we have the <em>potential</em> for our code to
      hang.</p>
      <p>For some deeper look into lazy-evaluation, I suggest looking at
      <a
      href="https://hackhands.com/lazy-evaluation-works-haskell/">this
      post</a> or <a
      href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell/Lazy_evaluation">the
      haskell wiki</a>.</p>
      <h2 id="another-look-at-trace">Another Look at
      <code>trace</code></h2>
      <p>Now that we have stronger background knowledge of Call-by-need,
      let’s go back to <code>trace</code>, the function which we have
      come to fear. Specifically <code>(b, c) = f a c</code>; this will
      test our understanding of lazy evaluation. Let’s re-write this
      function using better names than found in that Stack Overflow
      post, to try and appeal to intuition a bit more.</p>
      <div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre
      class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>trace f init_thunk <span class="ot">=</span> ans_thunk</span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="kw">where</span> (ans_thunk, feedback_thunk) <span class="ot">=</span> f init_thunk feedback_thunk</span></code></pre></div>
      <p>We need to understand<code>(b, c) = f a c</code> is only
      asserting that the name <code>c</code> is bound in the above way.
      Specifically “<code>f</code>’s second returned value will be the
      same <em>thunk</em> as <code>f</code>’s second parameter.” By
      inspecting <code>repminList [1..10]</code>, <code>trace</code>
      demands a value for <code>b</code>. In this case,
      <code>b = [c,c,c,c,c,c,c,c,c,c]</code>, where <code>c</code> is
      just that — whatever the value of <code>c</code> turns out to be.
      <code>c</code> itself has yet to be needed, and therefore yet to
      be evaluated. So <code>b</code> depends on the value of
      <code>c</code>, but not vice-versa, allowing our code not to hang.
      In the process of finding the value for <code>b</code>,
      <code>repminList'</code> has calculated the minimum element of the
      list, and bound that value back into <code>c</code>.</p>
      <p>And that’s that! We walk through the list, making a new list
      with a common placeholder value (just like the C solution)! This
      all works because of the laziness. This technique allows a whole
      host of computations that would normally require multiple passes
      over a data-structure to be done in a single pass!</p>
      <p>I strongly suggest playing with these functions to get a feel
      for what’s going on.</p>
      <h2 id="corecursion">Corecursion</h2>
      <p>We are correct in thinking <em>circular programming</em> is
      actually related to recursion: it is, in fact, the <em>dual to
      recursion</em>! <a
      href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00264249">Richard
      Bird</a> and <a
      href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~lloyd/tildeFP/1989SPE/">Lloyd
      Allison</a> were responsible for some of the early development of
      the technique “circular programming”, which would later be
      generalized into something known as <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corecursion">corecursion</a>.
      In recursion we take a big problem and break it down to it’s base
      cases. The idea behind corecusion is to start with the base cases,
      and build your data up. Corecursive algorithms produce small
      chunks of data, and then use them to make more complex (possibly
      infinite) data structures.</p>
      <p>For a simple and cute example, let’s consider generating a
      stream of the Fibonacci numbers.</p>
      <div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre
      class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>fibs <span class="ot">=</span> <span class="dv">0</span> <span class="op">:</span> <span class="dv">1</span> <span class="op">:</span> <span class="fu">zipWith</span> (<span class="op">+</span>) fibs (<span class="fu">tail</span> fibs)</span></code></pre></div>
      <p>Instead of defining a function in terms of itself, we have
      defined data in terms of itself! It’s a pretty neat and useful
      idea. For more examples, I suggest reading the Wikipedia post for
      corecursion — it gives as good of a treatment on the subject as I
      could.</p>
      <h2 id="parting-notes">Parting Notes</h2>
      <p>That was a brief introduction to circular programming, lazy
      evaluation, and in general how to define data in terms of itself
      (corecursion). Please let me know what you think/are confused by!
      I wrote this not only to help my own understanding, but hopefully
      to help others!</p>
