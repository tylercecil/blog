The expert steps in, and gives their assessment of the situation:

(@survive) "They might have survived", they explain.

Now tell me, with what little context you have, how did *you* read (@survive)?
*Did* they die? *Could* they still be out there? Was there something we could
have done to save them?

> If you assumed they died, you are a pessimist, and likely a drain on the
> people around you. If you assumed they lived, you're wrong --- they were all
> eaten alive by lions.

Today's very short post is about the **semantics of modality.** Really though,
it's just an excuse for me to share some amusing sentences, focused around
usage of the English words *may* and *might*; two words, I would venture, that
the average native English speaker has trouble defining, and in fact whose
meanings appears to be changing in modern English.

First, what exactly was the ambiguity in (@survive)?

(@log) "They might have survived, if the lions hadn't found them."
(@epi) "They might have survived --- we haven't found any bodies."

In (@log), it is clear that our heros met an unsavory end. However, (@epi) is
markedly more positive, expressing uncertainty about their fate. In both cases,
though, **the expert did not say they survived.** So then, how do we model this
sentence logically?

To answer that, we need to understand *logical modality*. I've actually
[written about modality before](posts/2020-02-13-reference.html#modal), but
let's recap.

Lovers separated by great distances feel comfort knowing that at night they can
look up and see the same stars. A bit like that, I feel comfort knowing that
every alternate reality me

Modality
: Modality expresses **necessity** or **possibility**.

## Types of Modality

"The set of all worlds" is kinda a tricky idea, though. As it happens,
