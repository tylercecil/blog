The expert steps in, and gives their assessment of the situation:

(@survive) "They might have survived", they explain.

Now tell me, with what little context you have, how did *you* read (@survive)?
*Did* they die? *Could* they still be out there? Was there something we could
have done to save them?

> If you assumed they died, you are a pessimist, and likely a drain on the
> people around you. If you assumed they lived, you're wrong --- they were all

Today's very short post is about the **semantics of modality.** Really though,
it's just an excuse for me to share some amusing sentences, focused around
usage of the English words *may* and *might*; two words, I would venture, that
the average native English speaker has trouble defining, and in fact whose
meanings appears to be changing in modern English.

# Modality

No matter how you read (@survive), we would all agree: **the expert did not say
they survived.**

$$ \cancel{\text{SURVIVE}(\text{they})} $$



## Logical
## Epistemic

# Other Modalities?
