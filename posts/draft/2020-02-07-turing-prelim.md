For as famous as it is, **I don't think most people understand the *Turing
Test*.** People seem to know that:

- A computer has a textual conversation with a human.
- The computer attempts to trick the human into thinking it isn't a machine.
- Turing said, if that computer succeeds, we should call it intelligent.

Unfortunately that's as far as most people go. They don't seem to ask
themselves *why* Turing thought that the *Imitation Game* defines intelligence.

Most seem to imagine *chatbots* like Weizenbaum's
[ELIZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA):

> **ELIZA:** Your boyfriend made you come here? \
> **Person:** He says I'm depressed much of the time. \
> **ELIZA:** I am sorry to hear that you are depressed. \
> **Person:** It's true. I am unhappy. \
> **ELIZA:** Do you think coming here will help you not to be unhappy? \
> **Person:** I need some help, that much seems certain.

> *"Neat, it sounds just like a human! It's obviously not very intelligent
> though... That Turing guy must have been wrong."*

Let me be clear here: **the Turing Test has nothing to do with being able to
hold a conversation.** And I can explain this best by... *not* writing a post
about the Turing Test.

Instead, today I'm going to write about a different test --- it's a kind of
"Mini Imitation Game." This test is going to distil the entire philosophical
spirit of the Imitation Game into a single, simple, well-defined linguistic
function. By doing this, we'll be left with a better understanding of the
Turing Test, perhaps a pragmatically more useful test of our own, and maybe
also a bit of wonder about how humans and language work. First thing is first,
though --- what *is* the philosophical spirit of the Imitation Game?

Why The Imitation Game
======================

::: comment :::
I *really* want a third section here, but it may have to be a very long
footnote.
3. This relates to "Linguistic Determinism" > "Linguistic Relativity" >
   Language of Thought.
   a. Even if there is some notion of "thought" that does not presupose language,
      it is not a question whether language with thought can capture that.
   b. Yes, there are intellectual tasks which could *also* be caried out without
      language
   c. Fun fact, ESP.
:::

When Turing wrote *Computing Machinery and Intelligence*, he started with a now
almost cliché question: *"can machines think?"* This would lead him to two
ideas --- one about intelligence, and another about language.

Intelligence
------------

On the intelligence side of things, Turing was concerned by the fact that "to
think" is a pretty undefined term. In fact, we almost treat it as a matter of
opinion.  Do I think? Do you think? Does my dog think? We tend to tie up the
word with some idea of a soul, or some other by-definition-undefinable quality.

Turing's solution to this problem was to avoid it entirely.

Turing's Definition of Intelligence
: Anything that *can* behave like a human must be *at least* as intelligent as
  one.

If it *behaves* like it's intelligent, who are you to say it isn't? Who cares
what's going on inside?

> *But Tyler, aren't there intelligent things that don't behave like humans?*

I don't know, and neither does Turing! All he is saying is **there aren't
things that behave like humans which aren't intelligent.**

$$ \text{Behave Thinky} \subseteq \text{Thinky} $$

Language
--------

> *Well... then how do humans behave?*

To answer this, Turing had a pretty powerful hot take:

Turing's Observation on Behavior
: There aren't tasks/behaviors which humans do, about which they cannot speak.

Describe one thing we do that is indescribable... It's OK, I'll wait. While
I'm waiting, let's make clear some things a human *could* speak about:

<div class="row" style="font-size: 90%">
<div class="one-half column">
- She could explain why one chess move is better than another.
- She could prove why a solution to a math problem is correct.
- She could describe any political system, as well as it's merits and
  detriments.
</div>
<div class="one-half column">
- She could express how she thinks someone else feels about something.
- She could hypothesize what would happen if people had wheels instead of legs.
- She could discuss why Turing saw language as central to intelligence.
</div>
</div>

Not a single thing on this list we would call a language skill --- instead we
have math, problem solving, hypothesizing, and empathizing. Turing wasn't
picturing asking a computer questions like "how are you today?" Instead, he was
thinking about questions like "what would go wrong if I made my desk out of
bacon?"

**The Turing test isn't a test about the mastery of language. It's a test about
the mastery of thinking, expressed through the universal medium of language.**

Shortcomings of Turing
======================

Now, I said this wasn't going to be a post about the Imitation Game. It's about
another test, which tries to patch up the problems with Turing's test. And
what are those problems? It's not the universal power of language. It's not
even his definition of intelligence. **The problem is people don't understand
the Turing Test!**

In 2014, in a perfect example of terrible journalism, the internet was abuzz
about [Eugene Goostman]().

1. There is a human judge
    a. The judge might not get the spirit of the test
    b. People might have different expectations
    c. Trickery of conversation

**The Turing test isn't a test about the mastery of language. It's a test about
the mastery of thinking, expressed through the universal medium of language.**

Now, I said this wasn't going to be a post about the Imitation Game. It's about
another test, which tries to patch up the problems with Turing's test. And
what are those problems? It's not the universal power of language. It's not
even his definition of intelligence. **The problem is people don't understand
the Turing Test!**
