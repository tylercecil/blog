In 2016 I graduated from New Mexico Tech with degrees in Mathematics and
Computer Science. I had recently attended the Oregon Programming Language
Summer School, which was an almost life changing experience. That same summer I
interned at Los Alamos Laboratories working with compilers and semantics.

As December rears it's head around, I can only think of one thing --- grad
school application deadlines. They come every year. Every year I do not apply.
Every year I wonder why, wonder what I am doing, will be doing, and have ever
been doing.

It brings me to tears.

Today I want to try and quantify what it is I've been doing, and what it is I
hope to be doing.
