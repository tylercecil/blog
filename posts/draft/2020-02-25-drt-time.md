Temporal Anaphora
=================

I actually learned about DRT in @book on "Tense and Aspect", which seems like
an unrelated place for this to turn up. When think of "tense", anaphora isn't
likely to be one of the first things to come in mind. Instead, you might think
"a verb phrase signals when and for how long an event takes place". This isn't
exactly always true, though.

(@ride) He got on his horse, and road off into the sunset.

The verb phrase "road off into the sunset" on its own doesn't actually say
anything about happening after "he got on his horse". Yet, we can pretty easily
put that timeline together.

Now before you say "ok, well, events are stated in the order they happened",
I'm going to have to jump in. In the next example, I'll label the time at
which each event happens.

(@hi) I [went]{.n1} up the stairs. The radio I [had heard]{.n2} over the
  telephone [was still blatting]{.n1} the baseball game.

Most of us would agree on this interpretation, and this certainly isn't a case
of "telling the events in the order they happened". [Had heard]{.n2} clearly
occurs before all other verbs, while [went]{.n1} and [was blatting]{.n1} are
happening at the same time!

In fact, this is an example of implicit temporal anaphora, relating when events
are happening relative to each other.

A DRT for Tense
---------------

One way to think about this interplay of time is to consider **time a discourse
referent**. As sentences are spoken, new "time variables" are introduced and
glued together. In fact, there are some pretty useful rules on how to do this!

In fact, there are some pretty useful rules on how to do this!

1. Let the initial time be $r_0$.
2. A temporal adverbial (like *"when she... "* or *"the next day"*) introduces
   a new time $r_{n+1}$, where $r_n$ was the current time.
3. A bounded event (like "he woke up") introduces a new time $r_{n+1}$._
4. Unbounded events (like "he was thinking") do not introduce new times.
5.
