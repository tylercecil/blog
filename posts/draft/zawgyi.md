Unicode Encoding: I think I'll just put links.

Burmese is pretty complicated encoding wise

Windows; Internet; People had to really *know* something about the encodings
they were using. Zawgyi was something you actually downloaded.

Zawgyi as a fat-encoding.
Multiple possible encodings for the same words
Always meant to be temporary
Zawgyi even changed because of a lawsuit

Starting with the monk-led protests in 2007, internet content began to explode.

Buisness interests solidifyied the font via dark-patterns
Unicode, endorsed by companies also... Hmm.
Smartphones today, fb, etc

The waterfall of information opression. Minority languages.
