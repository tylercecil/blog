Mathematical logic, despite being a bit obscure, gets used by a lot of other
fields. A computer scientist, linguist, and philosopher could conceivably be
reading something, and suddenly greeted by a mash of symbols like so

$$
\dfrac { \dfrac{ \dfrac{ \dfrac{}{A}u \quad \dfrac{}{B}w }
                       {A \wedge B} \wedge_I }
               {B \to A \wedge B} \to_{I^w}}
       { A \to B \to A \wedge B } \to_{I^u}
$$

The thing is, that same computer scientist, linguist, or philosopher could have
just as likely never taken a course on formal logic before, and might have just
audibly groaned out *"oooh nooo".* They might not even know how to Google what
the hell they're looking at right now.

This post is for anyone in one of these logic-adjacent fields (or anyone bored
in COVID-Quarantineâ„¢) who might be new to this notation. We'll cover:

As always, skip over what you know, jump to what's new, skim liberally --- and
this time I've included some exercises to play around with! **Now let's get to
it!**

Motivation
==========

I don't want this to be an introduction to proof theory, but it's probably
important to understand *why* natural deduction was invented. Otherwise we'd
just be talking about some random symbols with no context.

Natural deduction is what is known as a **formal proof system** or a **proof
calculus**.

Proof Calculus
: A proof calculus is a set of rules that describe how one can go from a set
  of assumptions (called **axioms**) to some conclusion.\
  It is called "formal" because these rules are syntactic --- that is, they
  only tell us how to move symbols around. We should be able to "mindlessly"
  read a formal proof.

Natural deduction was developed by the German mathematician Gerhard Gentzen in
1934, and is, what some might call, kinda a big deal. It[^sequent] rendered
older proof calculi[^hilbert] totally obsolete and has really been the gold
standard ever since.

Gentzen style systems can also be called **structural/analytic proofs**.
Normally in math, you write a proof *about* some mathematical object. In a
*structural proof*, the proof itself *is* a mathematical object. What the hell
does that mean? We can ask questions like *"is proof 1 equal to proof 2?"* or
*"can proof 1 combine with proof 2?"* Now we can **study the proofs
themselves.**

It is this structural property that makes Gentzen systems useful for computer
scientists, linguists, and philosophers.  For today, though, all we really need
to know is **natural deduction is a formal system for writing proofs.**

:::comment
maybe put this later on in the post to keep the flow exciting.

It's also worth mentioning that a Gentzen system could be developed for
different applications. Perhaps a linguist wants to use temporal logic to model
tense --- you could make a natural deduction proof for that. Or a computer
scientist wants to use linear logic to model a parallel system --- there's a
natural deduction system for that too.
:::


[^sequent]: I'm actually lying to you right now --- natural deduction has a
  brother called **the sequent calculus** which is *really* the gold standard.
  It's relatively similar, though, so no worries. At the end of this post I'll
  link to some resources on sequent calculus.

[^hilbert]: What were these older proof calculi, and what was bad about them?
  They are usually referred to as *"Hilbert Systems",* and probably the most
  famous such system was the one in *Principia Mathematica*. The main
  difference between a Gentzen system and a Hilbert system was that a Hilbert
  system preferred to used *axioms* instead of *inference rules*. That made
  them a bit difficult to deal with, which is why it took [Principia 379 pages
  to get to "1 + 1 =
  2".](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=umhistmath&cc=umhistmath&idno=aat3201.0001.001&frm=frameset&view=image&seq=401)

Reading Natural Deduction
=========================

To read a natural deduction proof, we ultimately only need to know two things:
what is a judgment, and what is an inference.

Judgment and Inference
----------------------

Judgment
: A Judgment is anything that is *knowable*. A judgment $\Gamma$ might be
  formal, such as *"$A$ is true"*, or informal, such as *"Matha is in love"*.

That is meant to be as vague as possible. You may want to judge the type of a
program, the veracity of a mathematical statement, or the meaning of a sentence
in Navajo.

The Inference Line
: Let $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ be judgements. We read $\cfrac{\Gamma}{\Delta}$ as
  *"$\Delta$ can be inferred from $\Gamma$".* $\Gamma$ is referred to as the
  **premise**, and $\Delta$ the **conclusion**. There might be zero or more
  premises, and always one conclusion.

Now reading these trees becomes pretty easy:

<div class="example">
$$ \cfrac{ \;A \quad B\; }{ A \wedge B } $$

::::center
 **Premise:** "$A$" is known and "$B$" is known.\
 **Conclusion:** "$A \wedge B$" can be known.
::::
</div>

And then, of course, they can be stacked:

<div class="example">
$$ \dfrac{\cfrac{ \;A \quad B\; }{ A \wedge B } \quad C}
         {(A \wedge B) \wedge C)} $$
</div>

Introduction and Elimination
----------------------------

OK, now that we can read the "flow" of a natural deduction proof, we need to
ask ourselves **"what conclusions are legal?"** There have to be rules, dammit!

And those rules will be our **introduction and elimination rules**. Every
symbol in our system will be defined by a set of introduction rules (telling us
when it's legal to *add* the symbol) and elimination rules (telling us when
we can *remove* it).

This is way better with an example, so let's start with *conjunction*.[^conj]

[^conj]: *Conjunction* here means "logical and". So when you see $A \wedge B$,
  it's usually read as "$A$ and $B$".

: The introduction and elimination rules for *conjunction.* By convention, the
  rule being used is written to the right of the inference line.

---------------------------------------- ----------------------------------
$\cfrac{A \quad B}{A \wedge B}\wedge_I$  **Introduction Rule**
$\cfrac{A \wedge B}{A}\wedge_{E1}$       **Elimination Rule 1**
$\cfrac{A \wedge B}{B}\wedge_{E2}$       **Elmination Rule 2**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

**These rules define how conjunction works.** Do you see how $\wedge_I$ allows
you to *introduce* the "$\wedge$" symbol, whereas $\wedge_{E1}$ and
$\wedge_{E2}$ allow you to eliminate it?

So that was pretty simple --- OK, now you try!

:::example

**Question:** What are the *Introduction Rules* for disjunction?[^dis] *(Hint:
there should be two).*

<button onclick="toggleDisplay('ans-1')">Show/Hide Answer</button>
:::::{.ans #ans-1}
--------------------------------  ---------------------------------
$\cfrac{A}{A \vee B}\vee_{I1}$    **Introduction Rule 1**
$\cfrac{B}{A \vee B}\vee_{I2}$    **Introduction Rule 2**
--------------------------------------------------------------------

That is, simply knowing either $A$ or $B$ is sufficient for knowing $A \vee B$.
:::::
:::

[^dis]: *Disjunction*, of course, means "logical or". Reading $A \vee B$ would
  read as "$A$ and/or $B$".

Now what about the *Elimination Rule* for $\vee$? Can you come up with an
English explanation of the rule? To write the rule down formally, we need one
last bit of notation.

Hypotheticals
-------------

What's missing is we have no way of working with "hypothetical situations".
Something like *"if $A$ were true (and I'm not saying it is), $B$ would
follow".*

Hypothetical
: A hypothetical premise $\Gamma$ is written as so:
  $$ \cfrac{}{\Gamma} x$$
  Where $x$ is a number unique for this hypothetical situation.

Now we can write down an Elimination Rule for disjunction![^super]

[^super]: Did you notice we called the rule $\vee_{E^{1,2}}$? The "1,2" is
  there to note that "this rule used hypothetical situations 1 and 2". That way
  we can keep track of what each hypothetical situation is doing.

$$
  \cfrac{A\vee B\quad\hypo{A}{1}{C}\quad\hypo{B}{2}{C}}{C}\vee_{E^{1,2}}
$$

In plain English:

+--------------------------------------------------+------------------+
|        I know                                    |   I conclude     |
+==================================================+==================+
| 1. $A \vee B$                                    | $C$ must be true.|
| 2. Hypothetically speaking, $A$ leads me to $C$. |                  |
| 3. Hypothetically speaking, $B$ leads me to $C$. |                  |
+--------------------------------------------------+------------------+

Now your turn!

:::example

**Question:** What are the Introduction and Elimination Rules for
  *implication*?[^imp]\
  *(Hint: You should need only 1 of each)*\
  *(Hint: You might notice that hypotheticals are already a kind of
  implication)*

<button onclick="toggleDisplay('ans-2')">Show/Hide Answer</button>
:::::{.ans #ans-2}
------------------------------------------    ---------------------------------
$\cfrac{\hypo{A}{1}{B}}{A \to B}\to_{I^1}$    **Introduction Rule 1**
$\cfrac{A\to B \quad A}{B}\to_{E}$            **Elimination Rule 1**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In plain English:

------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------
**Introduction:**  *having a proof from $A$ to $B$ can demonstrate $A \to B$.*
                   [^imp-ent]

**Elimination:**   *knowing $A$ and $A \to B$ can lead to $B$.*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:::::
:::

[^imp]: Implication, written as $A \to B$, means "*knowing $A$ leads to $B$".*

[^imp-ent]: Do you feel like you don't understand the difference between a
  hypothetical and implication? Don't worry, it's a subtle difference! They
  seem to capture the same idea of "assume $A$ gets you to $B$". The difference
  is that $A \to B$ is only a statement, and statements need proof. The proof
  for that statement takes the form of a hypothetical.

Writing Simple Proofs
=====================

I think $\wedge$, $\vee$, and $\to$ should be enough to test what we've
learned.[^bool] Let's work through some example proofs. **At each step, we can
only use one of the introduction and elimination rules we've defined**,
relisted here:

[^bool]: You might be asking me, "isn't this just Boolean Algebra, but hard?
  Can't I just write out a truth table to do this? We could actual define much
  more complicated rules for things like $\forall$ and $\exists$ (and even
  more!) that a truth table would never be able to deal with. For now, though,
  I just wanted to keep things simple.

:::{#rules}

  implication.

$$\dfrac{\hypo{A}{x}{B}}{A \to B}          $$\dfrac{A \quad A \to B}{B}\to_E$$
\to_{I^x}$$
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:::

Each proof will take some starting point $\Gamma$ to some conclusion $\Delta$.
I'll write $\Gamma \vdash \Delta$ to mean "use $\Gamma$ to prove $\Delta$".
[^turn]

[^turn]: Wait, another way to say *"from $x$ we conclude $y$"*, you ask? Don't
  get too caught up in this right now. I'm only going to use this notation to
  ask the question "can you prove this?" for the moment.

:::example
**Example 1:** prove that $A \to B,\; A \wedge C \vdash B$:

$$
\dfrac{\dfrac{A \wedge C}{A} \wedge_{E1}
       \quad
       A \to B}
      {B} \to_E
$$

:::

Make sure that you can read that, and that every step is justified. For the
next example, let's look at something using a hypothetical judgment.

:::example
**Example 2:** prove that $A \to B, \; B \to C \vdash A \to C$:

$$
\dfrac{ \dfrac{ \h{A}{1} \quad A \to B }{ B }\to_E
                \quad
                B \to C}
              { \dfrac{C}{A \to C}\to_{I^1} }\to_E
$$

:::

Notice how the hypothetical $\overline{A}^1$ gets used by the $\to_{I^1}$.
Every hypothetical must be eventualy used by some rule --- otherwise we would
just assume our goal and call it a day! **A proof tree with an unaccounted-for
hypothetical is an unfinished proof!**

Here are a few more exercises to try your hand at. When working through them,
don't be afraid to work backwards! You could write down the goal, and work your
way to the assumptions, or vice versa.

:::example

**Question 1:** Prove $A \wedge B,\; B \to C \vdash A \wedge C$

      {A \wedge C} \wedge_I
$$

      \quad\quad
      \dfrac{\dfrac{ \h{A}{1} \quad A \to B }
                   {B}\to_E
             \quad
             B \to C}
            {C}\to_E}
      {\dfrac{B \wedge C}{A \to (B \wedge C)}\to_{I^1}} \wedge_I
$$

Note that here, we used one hypothesis $\overline{A}^1$ twice; once to give use $B$,
and again to give us $C$. It is, of course, only one hypothesis, even though
it appears twice.

Lambda Calculus
===============

There are a glut of reasons why you might run into a natural deduction proof.
Philosophers have all kinds of reasons to study the process of reasoning.
Computer science's tie to logic is rather obvious --- often the semantics of
programming languages are described in terms of natural deduction inferences,
for example. Linguists have been using logic to model semantics ever since
Montague, and the study of syntax can be just as formal.

But each one of these fields all use another tool; one which seems much more
common place. And they might not know it, but that tool is bound tight to
natural deduction.

**I'm talking about $\lambda$-calculus!**[^lam]

[^lam]: Don't know what $\lambda$-calculus is? Then this section isn't for you!
  Consider reading a good introduction on the subject like [this
  one!](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/research/group/logic/TypesSS05/Extra/geuvers.pdf)

There is this idea known as **the Curry-Howard correspondence**, which very
loosely says one can convert between a proof and a program. Here, I want to
look at the most simple case of how this works, using only simply typed
$\lambda$-calculus.

Simple Type Proofs
------------------

In simply typed $\lambda$-calculus we write $x : A \to B$ to mean *"the element
$x$ is of type $A$ to $B$".* Well this "$\to$" is, in fact, the same "$\to$"
we've been looking at in natural deduction!

Normally I would take a baby example, and work our way up. This time, though,
I think we should dive right into a pretty meaty example. It might take you a
bit with a pen and paper to get it all, but don't worry, you have all the time
in the world! I won't be giving a test.

$$
\begin{align*}
  &M: ((A \to B) \to C) \to D\\
  &N: (A \to E) \to C\\
\end{align*}
$$

So we have two pre-defined terms $M$ and $N$. Using only those two terms, can
you write a lambda expression of type $(B \to E) \to D$?  Probably you can!
But let me change the question...

:::example
**Question:** Prove
<div style="font-size:80%;">
$$
((A \to B) \to C) \to D,\; (A \to E) \to C) \vdash (B \to E) \to D
$$
</div>
*(Just a warning, this one is pretty tedious)*

<button onclick="toggleDisplay('ans-6')">Show/Hide Answer</button>
:::::{.ans #ans-6}

$$
\dfrac{((A \to B) \to C) \to D
       \quad\quad
       \dfrac{(A \to E) \to C
              \quad\quad
              \dfrac{{\h{B \to E}{x}}
                     \quad
                     \dfrac{{\h{A\to B}{y}} \quad {\h{A}{z}}}{B}\to_E}
                    {\dfrac{E}{A \to E}{ \to_{Iz}}}\to_E
              }
             {\dfrac{C}{(A \to B) \to C}{\to_{Iy}}}\to_E
      }
      {\dfrac{D}{(B \to E) \to D}{\to_{Ix}}}\to_E
$$

:::::

:::

I want to zoom into the upper-right part of this tree really quick.

$$
\mhl{blue}{
\dfrac{\mhl{orange}{\dfrac{\h{B \to E}{x}
                    \quad
                    \mhl{red}{\dfrac{\h{A\to B}{y} \quad \h{A}{z}}{B}\to_E}}
                   {E}\to_E}}
      {A \to E} \to_{Iz}
}
$$

Now I'm going to re-write this; every hypothetical will be a variable, every
elimination will be a function application, and ever introduction will be a
lambda abstraction. *(I've added a little color highlighting to make this
clearer.)*

$$
\ol{\lambda z. \ul{x \ol{(y z)}{red}}{orange}}{blue} : A \to E
$$

> *You probably want to stare at that, and see how it lines up.*

Do you see what we've done? **We've converted a proof from assumptions to
conclusions into a program from variable to output.** Implication introduction
is the same as creating a function, and implication elimination is the same as
function application!

:::example
**Question:** Can you convert the rest of this proof into a lambda term?

<button onclick="toggleDisplay('ans-7')">Show/Hide Answer</button>
:::::{.ans #ans-7}
<div style="font-size: 120%;">
$$
\ul{\lambda x. M ( \ol{\lambda y. N( \ul{\lambda z. x(y z)}{blue})}{orange})}{red}: (B \to E) \to D
$$
</div>

Just for clarity, I've highlighted each lambda abstraction on the original
proof.

$$
\dfrac{((A \to B) \to C) \to D
       \quad\quad
       \dfrac{(A \to E) \to C
              \quad\quad
              \dfrac{{\color{red}\h{B \to E}{x}}
                     \quad
                     \dfrac{{\color{orange}\h{A\to B}{y}} \quad {\color{blue}\h{A}{z}}}{B}\to_E}
                    {\dfrac{E}{A \to E}{\color{blue} \to_{Iz}}}\to_E
              }
             {\dfrac{C}{(A \to B) \to C}{\color{orange}\to_{Iy}}}\to_E
      }
      {\dfrac{D}{(B \to E) \to D}{\color{red}\to_{Ix}}}\to_E
$$

For more practice, try converting the other exercises in this post! You'll need
to think a bit about how you might treat $\wedge$ and $\vee$ though...
:::::

:::

Now if you're thinking to yourself, "Tyler... it would have been *way* easier
to just write the lambda terms without any of this gobbledygook."

> Yes, that might be true! But it works the other way, too!

**You could write a lambda expression, and convert it back to a proof**. In
fact, the takeaway here is **lambda terms are proof trees.** But I can tell we
all have a little smoke coming out of our ears right now, so why don't I just
leave it here.

Further Reading
===============

I know this was a long post, but it was also very elementary. I just wanted to
set people up to be able to access and understand other introductory resources
on proof theory, natural deduction notation, and related things.

From here, I would *highly* recommend three resources

* [Frank Pfenning's "Basic Proof Theory" lectures from OPLSS
  2015](https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/summerschool/summer15/curriculum.html)
  A world-class introduction to proof theory.
* [Interactive Tutorial of the Sequent
  Calculus](http://logitext.mit.edu/tutorial)
  A very short but fun introduction to the Sequent Calculus --- the "big
  brother" of what we've been working on. It's an easy read, and (as the title
  says) is interactive!
* [Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/) for a
  deeper look into the Curry-Howard correspondence.  Everything you do in Coq
  revolves around this switching between natural deduction and lambda calculus.

**As always thanks for reading!** Leave a comment with any questions you might
have --- I'd love feedback to improve this post!
