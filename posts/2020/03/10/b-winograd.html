      <p>Going Beyond the Imitation Game</p>

        <div class="note">
      <strong>Note:</strong> Did you <em>also</em> not understand (or
      had never heard of) the Turing Test? I wrote a <a
      href="/posts/2020/03/10/a-turing-prelim.html">preliminary post</a>
      just for you!
    </div>
    
    <article>
      <p>In 2014, in what could be the poster-child of terrible science
      journalism, the internet was abuzz about <a
      href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27762088">Eugene
      Goostman</a>, supposedly the first AI to pass the Turing test.
      Normally I would toss this into the bucket of “things too stupid
      for my time”, but this debacle actually hints at something
      important. Scott Aaronson had a <a
      href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1858">conversation</a>
      with Eugene that really cut to the heart of the matter:<a
      href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Scott:</strong> How many legs does an ant have?<br />
      <strong>Eugene:</strong> Something between 2 and 4. Maybe, three?
      :-))) Oh, what a fruitful conversation;-)<br />
      <strong>Scott:</strong> Do you understand why I’m asking such
      basic questions?<br />
      <strong>Eugene:</strong> …wait<br />
      <strong>Scott:</strong> Do you think your ability to fool
      unsophisticated judges indicates a flaw with the Turing Test
      itself, or merely with the way people have interpreted the
      test?<br />
      <strong>Eugene:</strong> The server is temporarily unable to
      service your request due to maintenance downtime or capacity
      problems. Please try again later.<br />
      <strong>Scott:</strong> Do you think Alan Turing, brilliant though
      he was, had trouble imagining that the judges of his “imitation
      game” wouldn’t think to ask commonsense questions like the ones
      above –— or that, if they did, they’d actually accept evasion or
      irrelevant banter as answers?<br />
      <strong>Eugene:</strong> No, not really. I don’t think alan turing
      brilliant although this guy was had trouble imagining that the
      judges of his imitation game would not consider to Oooh. Anything
      else?<br />
      </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Yes Eugene… Anything else.</p>
      <p>This is a very real practical problem with the Imitation Game —
      <strong>people don’t always seem to get the point.</strong> If the
      judge doesn’t understand the test, the whole enterprise is
      worthless!</p>
      <p>That isn’t an argument against Turing, by the way; the Turing
      test stands as one of the most compelling definitions of
      intelligence we have. But for those who are interested in the
      study of intelligence, it may not be the most practical of
      tests.</p>
      <p>In this post, I want to introduce a kind of “Mini Imitation
      Game”. It will capture the philosophical spirit of the Imitation
      Game into a single, simple, well-defined linguistic function. This
      one linguistic function, I hope, will bring you as much wonder
      about humans and language as it does to me.</p>
      <h2 id="goals-for-a-new-test">Goals for a New Test</h2>
      <p>First thing is first: the human judge has to go. We want our
      new test to be totally non-subjective. We don’t want the human to
      go easy on the machine; we don’t want her to fall victim to cheap
      tricks like changing the subject; we don’t want her to chalk
      things up to a matter of opinion. Humans, obviously, carry out
      many subjective processes, but this test is going to be more
      limited in scope. So, no humans (who needs ’em?).</p>
      <p>Besides that, we have four main goals for our test:</p>
      <dl>
      <dt>Goal 1: it should be multiple choice.</dt>
      <dd>
      <ul>
      <li>The answer must be given (no avoiding the question).</li>
      <li>There is a measurably correct answer.</li>
      <li>The questions can be curated to cover specific abilities.</li>
      </ul>
      </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Think of a <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA">CAPTCHA</a> — you are
      forced to give an answer, and it better be the right one! (Unless
      it’s a <a
      href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18205610/google-captcha-ai-robot-human-difficult-artificial-intelligence">really
      hard one</a>.) Multiple choice will also let us measure progress —
      we could objectively say “this program scored 80%.”</p>
      <dl>
      <dt>Goal 2: it should stay in the language domain.</dt>
      <dd>
      The power of language is universal. This means we should be able
      to fit any possible task into language.
      </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>We want to capture the widest possible array of topics and
      abilities. “Intelligent” covers a lot of ground, and so should our
      test. Language is an ideal medium to express any and all
      intellectual abilities. (Besides, this is ostensibly a linguistics
      blog — you’d think I’d be writing about language.)</p>
      <dl>
      <dt>Goal 3: humans should score perfectly</dt>
      <dd>
      Because this new test should be non-subjective, it should be
      something that any human could do. A question might require some
      domain knowledge, but any normal human with that knoweledge should
      pass.
      </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Again, that’s just like CAPTCHA. It also demonstrates a
      weakening of the new challenge, because it would exclude
      subjective thinking.</p>
      <dl>
      <dt>Goal 4: it must be “hard”</dt>
      <dd>
      The test should be “Google proof”, meaning a computer couldn’t
      just answer questions by having access to huge amounts of data. It
      must require creative output of its own.
      </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Number 4 is obviously a moving target, but the hope is it
      should be similarly difficult to the Imitation Game (although, as
      I’ve already stated, will ultimately be easier).</p>
      <h2 id="winograd-schema">Winograd Schema</h2>
      <p>A very promising solution is known as the <em>“Winograd Schema
      Test”</em>, developed by Levesque <span class="citation"
      data-cites="levesque-2012">(<a href="#ref-levesque-2012"
      role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>. I said this new test was
      going to revolve around a single linguistic function, and as it
      happens, I introduced this linguistic function in my <a
      href="/posts/2020/02/24/drt.html#anaphora">last post on donkey
      sentences</a>: <strong>anaphora resolution.</strong></p>
      <dl>
      <dt>Anaphora</dt>
      <dd>
      Any expression whose interpretation depends on another expression
      elsewhere (called the antecedent if it occurred before, postcedent
      if it occurred after).<br />
      e.g. “I met <span class="n1">Uma</span> in October, when <span
      class="n1">she</span> still had a job.” Here the anaphora <span
      class="n1">“she”</span> referse back to the antecedent <span
      class="n1">“Uma”</span>.
      </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>In that post, we were a bit hand-wavy about how to resolve what
      an anaphora is referring to. And that’s because… well… it’s pretty
      complicated! To show what I mean, let’s look at our first Winograd
      Schema.</p>
      <ol class="example" type="1">
      <li>“<span class="n1">The trophy</span> doesn’t fit in <span
      class="n2">the brown suitcase</span> because <span
      class="nq">it’s</span> <span class="sp">too big.</span>”
      <div class="q">
      What is <span class="sp">too big</span>?
      <ul>
      <li><span class="n1">The trophy</span></li>
      <li><span class="n2">The brown suitcase</span>
      </div></li>
      </ul></li>
      </ol>
      <p>Now before you think (1) is simple to explain, consider the
      following:</p>
      <ol start="2" class="example" type="1">
      <li>“<span class="n1">The trophy</span> doesn’t fit in <span
      class="n2">the brown suitcase</span> because <span
      class="nq">it’s</span> <span class="sp">too small.</span>”
      <div class="q">
      What is <span class="sp">too small</span>?
      <ul>
      <li><span class="n1">The trophy</span></li>
      <li><span class="n2">The brown suitcase</span>
      </div></li>
      </ul></li>
      </ol>
      <p>Although (2) is <em>almost identical</em> to (1), you probably
      noticed (unless you are a robot) that the correct answer changed.
      To resolve this anaphora, one would have to know a thing or two
      about fitting, being big, and being small. And it’s not as simple
      as “big things won’t fit, and small things can’t contain”!</p>
      <ol start="3" class="example" type="1">
      <li>“<span class="n1">The shirt</span> doesn’t fit <span
      class="n2">the mannequin</span> because <span
      class="nq">it’s</span> <span class="sp">too
      big/small.</span>”</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In this case, <strong><span class="nq">it’s</span> is
      ambiguous;</strong> a shirt might not fit because it’s
      <em>either</em> too big <em>or</em> too small, and the same goes
      for a mannequin!<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> My point here is only to
      demonstrate how much knowledge and reasoning we used to understand
      the word <em>“it”.</em></p>
      <p>So, let’s finally write down a definition for a Winograd
      schema:</p>
      <dl>
      <dt>Winograd Schema</dt>
      <dd>
      <p>Take a sentence with the following properties:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Contains two noun phrases.</li>
      <li>Contains an anaphora which grammatically could refer to either
      NP.</li>
      <li>A <em>special word</em> determins which NP the anaphora
      referse to.</li>
      <li>The special word could be changed, such that the NP also
      changes.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the Winograd Schma Test, such a sentence is presented (with
      either possible special word), and one must determine which NP the
      anaphora referse to.</p>
      </dd>
      </dl>
      <h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
      <p>It might not be immediately obvious just how broad of a test
      this is, so it’s worth looking at some examples.</p>
      <ol start="4" class="example" type="1">
      <li>“<span class="n1">The large ball</span> crashed right through
      <span class="n2">the table</span> because <span
      class="nq">it</span> was made of <span
      class="sp">steel/styrofoam</span>.”
      <div class="q">
      What was made of <span class="sp">steel/styrofoam</span>?
      </div></li>
      </ol>
      <p>In (4), one would have to know a bit of physics to correctly
      answer, not to mention know those materials.</p>
      <p>One of my favorite examples was designed to demonstrate visual
      thinking:</p>
      <ol start="5" class="example" type="1">
      <li>“Sam tried to paint a picture of <span
      class="n1">shepherds</span> with <span class="n2">sheep</span>,
      but <span class="nq">they</span> ended up looking more like <span
      class="sp">dogs/golfers</span>.”
      <div class="q">
      What looked like <span class="sp">dogs/golfers</span>?
      </div></li>
      </ol>
      <p>Here’s an example demonstrating some problem solving
      skills:</p>
      <ol start="6" class="example" type="1">
      <li>“<span class="n1">The sack of potatoes</span> had been placed
      <span class="sp">above/below</span> <span class="n2">the bag of
      flour</span>, so <span class="nq">it</span> had to be moved first.
      <div class="q">
      What had to be moved first?
      </div></li>
      </ol>
      <h3 id="cross-linguistic">Cross Linguistic</h3>
      <p>Of course, all languages have anaphora (<a
      href="/posts/2020/02/24/drt.html#not-just-nouns">of many
      types</a>), so we’re not bound to English. We could translate (6)
      into Japanese, for example:</p>
      <ol start="7" class="example" type="1">
      <li>じゃがいもの入った袋が、小麦粉の入った袋の<strong>[上/下]</strong>にあるので
      、最初にそれを動かさなければならない。
      <div class="q">
      最初に動かさなければならないのは何か？
      </div></li>
      </ol>
      <p>However, not <em>all</em> schema are translatable. Terry
      Winograd (for whom these are named after) produced one such
      example <span class="citation" data-cites="winograd-1972">(<a
      href="#ref-winograd-1972"
      role="doc-biblioref">1972</a>)</span>:</p>
      <ol start="8" class="example" type="1">
      <li>“<span class="n1">The city councilmen</span> refused to give
      <span class="n2">the women</span> a permit for a demonstration
      because <span class="nq">they</span> <span
      class="sp">feared/advocated</span> violence”</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In English this is perfectly fine. However, (8) could never be
      translated to French, because the gender of “they” would not match
      both noun phrases (it would either be a masculine or feminine
      “they”). In this case, the <em>grammatic</em> ambiguity is lost.<a
      href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> Similarly, a Hungarian example
      might not work in English, because Hungarian has no gender system
      at all.</p>
      <h3 id="avoiding-easy-questions">Avoiding Easy Questions</h3>
      <p>Goal #4 was for the challenge to be hard, and unfortunately
      there are Winograd schema that are just a tad too easy for our
      tastes. What would make a test easy? <span class="citation"
      data-cites="levesque-2012">H. Levesque, Davis, and Morgenstern (<a
      href="#ref-levesque-2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>
      identify two main classes of easy problems.</p>
      <h4 id="ease-of-category">Ease of Category</h4>
      <ol start="9" class="example" type="1">
      <li>“<span class="n1">The women</span> stopped taking <span
      class="n2">the pills</span> because <span class="nq">they</span>
      were <span class="sp">pregnant/carcinogenic</span>.”</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In this case, no complex understanding is actually required.
      All one needs to know is</p>
      <ol type="1">
      <li>Woman are rarely carcinogenic.</li>
      <li>Pills are rarely pregnant.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>That’s really the end of the story. To answer this schema, one
      <em>only</em> needs to be aware of <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_mistake">category
      mistakes</a>.</p>
      <h4 id="easily-googleable">Easily “Googleable”</h4>
      <ol start="10" class="example" type="1">
      <li>“<span class="n1">The racecar</span> zoomed by <span
      class="n2">the school bus</span> because <span
      class="nq">it</span> was so <span class="sp">fast/slow.</span>”
      <div class="q">
      What was <span class="sp">fast/slow</span>?
      </div></li>
      </ol>
      <p>This schema has what Levesque calls the “googleable problem.”
      In (10), indeed slow and fast <em>could</em> be attributed to both
      <span class="n1">the racecar</span> and <span class="n2">the
      school bus</span>, but there is a <em>strong association</em> with
      racecars and speed. Simply knowing that “fast” and “racecare”
      appear near each other in texts would be enough to solve this
      schema.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
      <p>We want to avoid cases like this, which could be easily solved
      by systems such as <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_(computer)">IBM’s
      Watson</a>, which only use statistical methods to answer
      questions. For example:</p>
      <ol start="11" class="example" type="1">
      <li><span class="n1">Fred</span> is the only man alive who still
      remembers <span class="n2">my father</span> as an infant. When
      Fred first saw my father, <span class="nq">he</span> was twelve
      <span class="sp">years/months</span> old.
      <div class="q">
      Who was twelve <span class="sp">years/months</span> old?
      </div></li>
      </ol>
      <p>It’s hard to imagine a system using only “dumb” statistical
      methods being able to answer (11). What corpus would possibly
      contain an answer?</p>
      <h3 id="avoiding-hard-questions">Avoiding Hard Questions</h3>
      <p>If we’re not careful, we might go in the other direction, and
      introduce sentences which humans aren’t actually able to
      solve.</p>
      <ol start="12" class="example" type="1">
      <li>“<span class="n1">Frank</span> was <span
      class="sp">jealous/pleased</span> when <span
      class="n2">Bill</span> said that <span class="nq">he</span> was
      the winner
      <div class="q">
      Who was the winner?
      </div></li>
      </ol>
      <p>In the first case, Frank is jealous that Bill won. In the other
      case, however, there isn’t a clear answer. Is Frank happy for
      Bill, or is Frank happy for himself? Without more context, this
      question isn’t necessarily answerable.</p>
      <h3 id="better-than-turing">Better Than Turing?</h3>
      <p>Levesque makes the claim that the Winograd Schema Challenge can
      be seen as a replacement for the Turing test <span
      class="citation" data-cites="levesque-2012">(<a
      href="#ref-levesque-2012" role="doc-biblioref">2012</a>)</span>.
      It may be the case that a huge number of intellectual tasks can be
      encoded into a schema, but I think it’s almost self-evident that
      this is a weaker test.</p>
      <p><span class="math display">\[\text{Winograd Passing}
      \subsetneqq \text{Turing Passing}\]</span></p>
      <p>In fact, I would argue that any test which is multiple choice /
      non-ambiguous would have this property, as much intelligent
      behaviour is creative and ambiguous. Reading comprehension (the
      heart of this challenge) is likely a much simpler task than that
      of creative synthesis.</p>
      <p>That being said, it has a huge amount of pragmatic benefits.
      Perhaps my favorite aspect of Winograd schema is <strong>it helps
      people understand what the point of the Imitation Game really
      is.</strong> It shows off how effortlessly we leverage complex
      reasoning into simple sentences.</p>
      <h2 id="current-progress">Current Progress</h2>
      <p>So, to get to everyone’s first question: <strong>how well do
      machines score on the test?</strong></p>
      <p>The answer: <strong>not great!</strong></p>
      <p>In 2016 <em>Nuance Communications</em> hosted <a
      href="http://commonsensereasoning.org/winograd.html">a
      competition</a>, in which no program even qualified to compete
      (having failed a “easy” Round 1). <span class="citation"
      data-cites="liu-2016">Liu et al. (<a href="#ref-liu-2016"
      role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> had a very thorough report
      on their approach to that competition, which scored 66.7%, a
      state-of-the-art result at the time. Remember, just “guessing”
      would yield 50%, so there’s plenty of work to be done.</p>
      <p>More recent results report scores as high as 72%, a small but
      impressive edge above guessing <span class="citation"
      data-cites="kocijan-2019">(<a href="#ref-kocijan-2019"
      role="doc-biblioref">Kocijan et al. 2019</a>)</span>.</p>
      <h2 id="future-tests">Future Tests</h2>
      <p>I believe this challenge will be a useful one for those
      interested in AI and Linguistics for some time to come. Still, an
      interesting thought experiment is what tests might be used in the
      future, building off of Levensque’s test.</p>
      <p>For example, <span class="citation"
      data-cites="levesque-2014">H. J. Levesque (<a
      href="#ref-levesque-2014" role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>
      presents an unusual schema:</p>
      <ol start="13" class="example" type="1">
      <li><span class="n1">The large ball</span> crashed right through
      <span class="n2">the table</span> because <span
      class="nq">it</span> was made of <span class="sp">XYZ</span>.
      <div class="q">
      What was made of <span class="sp">XYZ</span>?
      </div></li>
      </ol>
      <p>Unsurprisingly this is pretty hard to answer. But what if the
      question also included the following?</p>
      <div class="example">
      <ol type="1">
      <li>XYZ is a trademarked product of Dow Chemical.</li>
      <li>XYZ is usually white, but there are green and blue
      varieties.</li>
      <li>XYZ is ninety-eight percent air, making it lightweight and
      buoyant.</li>
      <li>XYZ was first discovered by a Swedish inventor, Carl Georg
      Munters.</li>
      </ol>
      </div>
      <p>Now we could talk about “Extended-Winograd-Schema” which
      include information like that above.</p>
      <p>Another possible idea would be resolving non-noun-phrase
      anaphora. Temporal anaphora could be interesting.</p>
      <ol start="14" class="example" type="1">
      <li>Russell had a party last Friday, and his donkey got drunk. I
      left before the drinking started, and couldn’t believe the stories
      I heard that morning.
      <div class="q">
      Order the following events:
      <ul>
      <li>Russell has a party</li>
      <li>Donkey became drunk</li>
      <li>Drinking starts</li>
      <li>I leave</li>
      <li>I can’t believe stories
      </div></li>
      </ul></li>
      </ol>
      <p>This would be tricky depending on the language, however, as
      some languages are very grammatically clear with temporal order.
      In English, the morphology largely gives the order of events, but
      in Lao one could only use reason to build a logical timeline.</p>
      <p>I <em>personaly</em> would be interested in tests of creativity
      (which, by definition, couldn’t be multiple choice). For example,
      the test could be to find a possible special word.</p>
      <ol start="15" class="example" type="1">
      <li>What is a word for “XYZ” in (13) would cause the answer to be
      <span class="n1">the large ball</span>?</li>
      </ol>
      <h2 id="notes-and-further-reading">Notes and Further Reading</h2>
      <p>For more information and reasoning about Winograd schema, I’d
      recommend <span class="citation" data-cites="levesque-2014">H. J.
      Levesque (<a href="#ref-levesque-2014"
      role="doc-biblioref">2014</a>)</span>. Perhaps more fun, though,
      would be to look at <a
      href="https://cs.nyu.edu/faculty/davise/papers/WinogradSchemas/WS.html">this
      list</a> of 150 schema, with commentary, available in English,
      Chinese, Japanese, French, and Portuguese. A collection of
      state-of-the-art results can be found at that site as well.</p>
      <p>For a more linguistic analysis of the schema, I’d recommend
      <em>“The Role of Pragmatics in Solving the Winograd Schema
      Challenge”</em> <span class="citation"
