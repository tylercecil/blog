      <strong>Note:</strong> I originally wrote this as a introduction
      to my <a href="/posts/2020/03/10/b-winograd.html">Winograd Schema
      post</a>, but cut it. Because not all my readers are familiar with
      the Turing Test, however, I made it into a short and easy
      standalone post. It’s not as polished as my normal posts. If you
      are familiar with the Turing Test, feel free to skip to the <a

    <article>
      <p>For as famous as it is, <strong>I don’t think most people
      understand the <em>Turing Test</em>.</strong> People seem to know
      that:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>A computer has a textual conversation with a human.</li>
      <li>The computer attempts to trick the human into thinking it
      isn’t a machine.</li>
      <li>Turing said, if that computer succeeds, we should call it
      intelligent.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Unfortunately that’s as far as most people go. They don’t seem
      to ask themselves <em>why</em> Turing thought that the
      <em>Imitation Game</em> defines intelligence.</p>
      <p>Most seem to imagine <em>chatbots</em> like Weizenbaum’s <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA">ELIZA</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><strong>ELIZA:</strong> Your boyfriend made you come
      here?<br />
      <strong>Person:</strong> He says I’m depressed much of the
      time.<br />
      <strong>ELIZA:</strong> I am sorry to hear that you are
      depressed.<br />
      <strong>Person:</strong> It’s true. I am unhappy.<br />
      <strong>ELIZA:</strong> Do you think coming here will help you not
      to be unhappy?<br />
      <strong>Person:</strong> I need some help, that much seems
      certain.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
      <p><em>“Neat, it sounds just like a human! It’s obviously not very
      intelligent though… That Turing guy must have been
      wrong.”</em></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Let me be clear here: <strong>the Turing Test has nothing to do
      with being able to hold a conversation.</strong></p>
      <p>This week I’m writing about a different test — it’s a kind of
      “Mini Imitation Game.” But before I do that, some might need a
      taste of the original Imitation Game. This post is a short
      introduction to the Turing Test, getting at the question <em>“why
      did Turing consider the Imitation Game a suitable definition of
      intelligence?”</em></p>
      <h2 id="why-the-imitation-game">Why The Imitation Game</h2>
      <p>When Turing wrote <em>Computing Machinery and
      Intelligence</em>, he started with a now almost cliché question:
      <em>“can machines think?”</em> This would lead him to two ideas —
      one about intelligence, and another about language.</p>
      <h3 id="intelligence">Intelligence</h3>
      <p>On the intelligence side of things, Turing was concerned by the
      fact that “to think” is a pretty undefined term. In fact, we
      almost treat it as a matter of opinion. Do I think? Do you think?
      Does my dog think? We tend to tie up the word with some idea of a
      soul, or another by-definition-undefinable quality.</p>
      <div class="comment">
      <p>Something about racist views of thinking?</p>
      </div>
      <p>Turing’s solution to this problem was to avoid it entirely.</p>
      <dl>
      <dt>Turing’s Definition of Intelligence</dt>
      <dd>
      Anything that <em>can</em> behave like a human must be <em>at
      least</em> as intelligent as one.
      </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>If it <em>behaves</em> like it’s intelligent, who are you to
      say it isn’t? Who cares what’s going on inside? Turing is saying
      that looking into the black-box of intelligence isn’t necessary to
      know something can think — the only thing that’s important is how
      something acts.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><em>But Tyler, aren’t there intelligent things that can’t
      behave like humans?</em></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>I don’t know, and neither does Turing! All he is saying is
      <strong>there aren’t things that can behave like humans which
      aren’t intelligent.</strong></p>
      <p><span class="math display">\[ \text{Behave Thinky} \subseteq
      \text{Thinky} \]</span></p>
      <h3 id="language">Language</h3>
      <blockquote>
      <p><em>Well… then how do humans behave?</em></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>To answer this, Turing had a pretty powerful hot take:</p>
      <dl>
      <dt>Turing’s Observation on Intelligence</dt>
      <dd>
      There aren’t tasks/behaviors which humans do, about which they
      cannot speak.
      </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Describe one thing we do that is indescribable… It’s OK, I’ll
      wait. While I’m waiting, let’s make clear some things a human
      <em>could</em> speak about:</p>
      <div class="multicol" style="font-size: 90%">
      <div>
      <ul>
      <li>She could explain why one chess move is better than
      another.</li>
      <li>She could prove why a solution to a math problem is
      correct.</li>
      <li>She could describe any political system, as well as it’s
      merits and detriments.</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
      <ul>
      <li>She could express how she thinks someone else feels about
      something.</li>
      <li>She could hypothesize what would happen if people had wheels
      instead of legs.</li>
      <li>She could discuss why Turing saw language as central to
      intelligence.</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p>Not a single thing on this list we would call a language skill
      — instead we have math, problem solving, hypothesizing, and
      empathizing. Turing wasn’t picturing asking a computer questions
      like “how are you today?” Instead, he was thinking about questions
      like “what would go wrong if I made my desk out of bacon?”</p>
      <p><strong>The Turing test isn’t a test about the mastery of
      language. It’s a test about the mastery of thinking, expressed
      through the universal medium of language.</strong></p>
      <h2 id="language-and-thought">Language and Thought</h2>
      <p>“The universal medium of language” is an incredibly powerful
      idea, central to the Turing test, and much modern thought. The
      idea is pretty simple: <strong>you can’t name something you can’t
      talk about,</strong> because if you did, then you’re talking about
      it.</p>
      <p>There are many ideas out there about the relationship between
      language and thought. <em>Linguistic Determinism</em> and
      <em>Linguistic Relativity</em> are strong and weak versions of the
      idea that language <em>is</em> thought. <em>Language of
      Thought</em> theories argue that expressed language is not
      essential for unexpressed thought. Chompsky’s independent theory
      argues that language is one cognitive system, working in concert
      with many others. But in all of these cases, we run into the same
      conclusion: <strong>language is our only way of expressing our own
      cognition.</strong> To quote Chomsky:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><em>Language is a mirror of mind in a deep and significant
      sense. It is a product of human intelligence… By studying the
      properties of natural languages, their structure, organization,
      and use, we may hope to learn something about human nature;
      something significant, if it is true that human cognitive capacity
      is the truly distinctive and most remarkable characteristic of the
      species.</em></p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2 id="what-did-turing-picture">What Did Turing Picture?</h2>
      <p>Turing was clear that his game was a high bar for intelligence.
      He considered passing to be sufficient, albeit not necessary, in
      saying something is intelligent. And he went out of his way to
      defend the power of his definition, even addressing how the test
      would have to change for humans with psychic abilities (yes,
      that’s real).</p>
      <p>To wrap things up, here’s a now famous excerpt from Turing’s
      original paper. I think it gives us a flavor for what he was
      picturing when he wrote about the Imitation Game.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Interrogator:</strong> In the first line of your sonnet
      which reads “Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day”, would not “a
      spring day” do as well or better?<br />
      <strong>Witness:</strong> It wouldn’t scan.<br />
      <strong>Interrogator:</strong> How about “a winter’s day.” That
      would scan all right.<br />
      <strong>Witness:</strong> Yes, but nobody wants to be compared to
      a winter’s day.<br />
      <strong>Interrogator:</strong> Would you say Mr. Pickwick reminded
      you of Christmas?<br />
      <strong>Witness:</strong> In a way.<br />
      <strong>Interrogator:</strong> Yet Christmas is a winter’s day,
      and I do not think Mr. Pickwick would mind the comparison.<br />
      <strong>Witness:</strong> I don’t think you’re serious. By a
      winter’s day one means a typical winter’s day, rather than a
      special one like Christmas.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Could it be that there are intelligences out there which
      couldn’t communicate like this? Quite possibly. But if you were to
      claim that the Witness in this dialog wasn’t intelligent, that
      says a lot more about you, than it does about the Witness.</p>
