  abstract = {Contraction of want to to wanna is subject to constraints that have been related to the operation of Universal Grammar. Contraction appears to be blocked when the trace of an extracted wh-word intervenes. Evidence for knowledge of these constraints by young English-speaking children has been taken to show the operation of Universal Grammar in early child language acquisition. The present study investigates knowledge of these constraints in adults, both English native speakers and advanced Korean learners of English. The results of three experiments − using elicited production, oral repair, and grammaticality judgments − confirmed native speaker knowledge of the constraints. A second process of phonological elision may also operate to produce wanna. Learners also showed some differentiation of contexts, but much less clearly than native speakers. We speculate that non-natives may be using rules of complement selection, rather than the constraints of Universal Grammar (UG) to control contraction.},

  abstract = {The forms represented orthographically as {$<$}wanna{$>$}, {$<$}hafta{$>$}, {$<$}gonna{$>$}, {$<$}gotta{$>$}, {$<$}oughta{$>$}, {$<$}usta{$>$}, and {$<$}sposta{$>$} have standardly been analyzed as involving a syntactic rule or cliticization operation called to-contraction. Occasionally it has been suggested that the forms in question have been 'lexicalized', i.e., WANNA and HAFTA are synchronically distinct lexemes from WANT and HAVE. I argue here that neither approach is correct. The syntactic accounts are wrong to assume that the relation between wanna and want to must be syntactic, and the lexicalization accounts are wrong to assume that there is no synchronic relation: the link is one of derivational morphology. A morpholexical rule suffixes /tu/ ∼ /tǝ/ to the base lexemes to form derived lexemes such as WANNA. These to-derivatives are headed morphological structures, as described by Stump 1994. They inflect on their heads, not their edges; they are synonymous with their bases but have different subcategorization and more colloquial style associations. Various morphological and phonological idiosyncrasies indicate that the derived lexemes are morphologically compound, but their sharing of the lexical idiosyncrasies of the base lexemes show that they contain those bases as heads. All the syntactic phenomena that have been claimed to be relevant to the debate over to-contraction fall into place under the assumptions advocated here, and some new insights emerge, particularly with regard to the 'liberal dialects' where the pronunciation written {$<$}wanna{$>$} has a wider distribution than in most American dialects.},

  abstract = {Previous research has suggested that very young children learning English adhere quite rigidly to a grammatical constraint on the possible contexts for contraction of want and to into the reduced form wanna. Two elicited production studies reported here suggest that young children do produce wanna in illicit contexts. One study identifies one factor that offers a partial explanation for the conflicting results, but this factor alone does not completely explain the earlier nearly categorical results observed for children. Our findings cast doubt on the claim that children have innate knowledge of a categorical constraint against contraction over a trace or of any absolute constraint on the occurrence of wanna, and highlight the need for further developmental work.},
