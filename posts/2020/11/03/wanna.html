      <p>The Story of Wanna-Contraction</p>
      <p><small>Posted on 2020-11-03</small></p>
          </header>

    
    <article>
      <p>Most English speakers, I think, would agree that these two
      sentences are essentially the same:</p>
      <ol class="example" type="1">
      <li>I <em>want to</em> go to the party! <span
      class="math inline">\(\Leftrightarrow\)</span> I <em>wanna</em> go
      to the party!</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Now, I need to make a confession: <em>I don’t know a single
      thing about phonetics or phonology.</em> But, in my ignorance, I
      wouldn’t have thought twice about (1) — I would have just said
      something like:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>This is some basic phonetic thing! The more frequently you say
      something, the more you can fudge the pronunciation. No big
      deal.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>That is… until last month. You see, <strong>there are times
      when <em>“wanna”</em> is flat-out wrong.</strong></p>
      <ol start="2" class="example" type="1">
      <li>Who do you <em>want to</em> kiss that puppy? (I want Douglas
      to kiss that puppy!)</li>
      <li><span class="bad">Who do you <em>wanna</em> kiss that
      puppy?</span></li>
      </ol>
      <p>Would I <em>understand</em> someone who said it? Of course.
      But, if I were speaking naturally, I just wouldn’t say it. Try
      saying both the sentences in (1) slowly; now try (3) — it just
      sounds strange.</p>
      <p>And it’s not simply that <em>some sentences</em> can’t use
      “wanna” — the <em>meaning</em> of the sentence seems to matter!
      For example, let’s say you and your friends are going to watch a
      very exciting basketball game.</p>
      <ol start="4" class="example" type="1">
      <li>Let’s watch the game! Who do you <em>want to</em> win? (I want
      the 76ers to win!)</li>
      <li>Let’s watch the game! <span class="bad">Who do you
      <em>wanna</em> win?</span></li>
      </ol>
      <p>But now, picture some very shady team owners, gambling their
      players away.</p>
      <ol start="6" class="example" type="1">
      <li>Who do you <em>want to</em> win? (I want to win Joel
      Embiid!)</li>
      <li>Who do you <em>wanna</em> win? (I wanna win Joel Embiid!)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Clearly <strong>just because “want” and “to” are near each
      other doesn’t mean you can use “wanna”!</strong> This isn’t a
      phonological property of English; there are grammar rules
      dictating when and where “wanna” can pop up in a sentence!
      <strong>The question is, what are those rules?</strong></p>
      <p>Today’s post will try and tackle that question in three
      acts.</p>
      <table class="toc">
      <colgroup>
      <col style="width: 25%">

      <td>
      <strong><a href="#a-better-solution">Act 3</a></strong>
      </td>

      wanna-question.

      <p><strong>Act 1</strong> — The explanation of “wanna” you are
      sure to find in your textbook.</p>
      </div>
      <p>So-called <strong>wanna-contraction</strong> (or
      <strong>to-contraction</strong>) has been something of a hot topic
      ever since the 1970’s. At that time, some certain linguists at a
      certain university in Massachusetts were developing pretty
      groundbreaking theories about language.<a href="#fn1"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> A prominent piece of those
      theories is something called <em>movement</em>.</p>
      <dl>
      <dt><a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_movement">Movement</a></dt>
      <dd>
      In a syntax tree, certain rules may cause nodes to jump to
      different positions in the tree.<br />
      <strong>e.g.</strong> In English, questions cause verb
      movement:<br />
      “You can do it!” <span class="math inline">\(\Rightarrow\)</span>
      “Can you do it?”
      </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Let’s look at a very well-known type of movement:
      <strong>wh-movement.</strong></p>
      <div class="example">
      <p><strong>Example:</strong> Consider the sentence <em>“you do
      like him”.</em> What if we didn’t know <em>who</em> was liked?</p>
      <p><strong>“You do like him”<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> <span
      class="math inline">\(\Rightarrow\)</span> “Who(m) do you
      like?”</strong></p>

      <col style="width: 61%" />

      <tbody>
      <tr class="odd">
      <td style="text-align: left;">You <span class="t1">do</span> like
      him.</td>
      <td style="text-align: left;">The auxiliary verb is “do”.</td>
      </tr>

      class="t1"><span class="math inline">\(\square\)</span></span>
      like him?</td>
      <td style="text-align: left;">In English, questions move the
      auxiliary verb to the first position.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="odd">
      <td style="text-align: left;"><span class="t1">Do</span> you <span
      class="t1"><span class="math inline">\(\square\)</span></span>
      like <span class="t2">whom</span>?</td>
      <td style="text-align: left;">For our question we want to use
      “who(m)” instead of “him”.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="even">
      <td style="text-align: left;"><span class="t2">Whom</span> <span
      class="t1">do</span> you <span class="t1"><span

      class="t2"><span
      class="math inline">\(\square\)</span></span>?</td>
      <td style="text-align: left;">In English, “wh”-phrases get moved
      to the beginning of the sentence (even before the auxiliary
      verb).</td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
      </table>
      </div>
      <p><strong>Now what does this have to do with
      wanna-contraction?</strong></p>
      <h3 id="silent-words">Silent Words</h3>
      <p>I’m not sure who first noted the idiosyncrasies with “wanna”
      usage, but <span class="citation" data-cites="chomsky1978">Chomsky
      and Lasnik (<a href="#ref-chomsky1978"
      role="doc-biblioref">1978</a>)</span> were the first to provide a
      captivating explanation. You see, in the theory of movement, words
      don’t <em>just</em> move — they leave something behind!</p>
      <dl>
      <dt><a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_movement#Traces">Trace</a></dt>
      <dd>
      A trace is a hypothetical <em>silent word</em>, which is left
      behind whenever movement occurs in a tree. Traces are usually
      marked with a “<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>”.<br />
      <strong>e.g.</strong> In “<span class="t2">Who</span> <span
      class="t1">do</span> you <span class="t1"><span
      class="math inline">\(t_{\text{do}}\)</span></span> like <span
      class="t2"><span
      class="math inline">\(t_{\text{who}}\)</span></span>?”, we see two
      traces, each corresponding to a different instance of movement.
      </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Chomsky and Lasnik were looking for evidence that silent
      words<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>… you know… actually existed.
      While doing so, they saw these problems with “wanna”, and made a
      pretty interesting observation:</p>
      <div class="example">
      <p><strong>Whenever a trace is found between “want” and “to”, it
      seems to “block” contraction.</strong></p>
      <table>
      <colgroup>
      <col style="width: 50%" />
      <col style="width: 50%" />
      </colgroup>
      <tbody>
      <tr class="odd">
      <td style="text-align: left;">I want to kiss him.<br />
      Who do I <strong>want to</strong> kiss <strong><span
      class="math inline">\(t_\text{who}\)</span></strong>?<br />
      <span class="good">Who do I wanna kiss?</span></td>
      <td style="text-align: left;">There is no trace between “want” and
      “to”.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="even">
      <td style="text-align: left;">I want him to kiss the dog.<br />
      Who do I <strong>want <span
      class="math inline">\(t_\text{who}\)</span> to</strong> kiss the
      dog?<br />
      <span class="bad">Who do I <strong>wanna</strong> kiss the
      dog?</span></td>
      <td style="text-align: left;">There is a trace sitting between
      “want” and “to”, which blocks the contraction!</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="odd">
      <td style="text-align: left;">I want him to win<br />
      Who do I <strong>want <span
      class="math inline">\(t_{\text{who}}\)</span> to</strong>
      win?<br />
      <span class="bad">Who do I wanna win?</span></td>
      <td style="text-align: left;">Notice we have <em>“want him
      to”</em> in the first sentence. That “him” becomes a trace in the
      question form.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="even">
      <td style="text-align: left;">I want to win him<br />
      Who do I <strong>want to</strong> win <span
      class="math inline">\(t_\text{who}\)</span>?<br />
      <span class="good">Who do I wanna win?</span></td>
      <td style="text-align: left;">If “wanna” would work in the
      non-question sentence, it will work in the question form as
      well.</td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
      </table>
      </div>
      <p>That’s what I’m calling the “old-school answer”: <strong>silent
      words are blocking “want” and “to” from contracting!</strong></p>
      <h2 id="problematic-data">Problematic Data</h2>
      <div class="note">
      <p><strong>Act 2</strong> — A whole list of sentences the
      old-school answer doesn’t seem to address.</p>
      </div>
      <p>The old-school answer (that traces are the reason “wanna” isn’t
      always allowed) can be found in basically any textbook on syntax
      <span class="citation" data-cites="falk2011">(<a
      href="#ref-falk2011" role="doc-biblioref">Falk 2011</a>)</span>;
      I, for one, learned about it from <span class="citation"
      data-cites="carnie2013">Carnie (<a href="#ref-carnie2013"
      role="doc-biblioref">2013, chaps. 5, p.369</a>)</span>. And that’s
      frankly pretty odd, <strong>because it seems to be
      incorrect</strong>.</p>
      <p>I don’t mean <em>movement</em> is dubious (that’s a whole other
      debate). It just doesn’t explain what’s going on with “wanna”. You
      see, there’s a whole host of other situations where “wanna” just
      doesn’t seem to fit.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
      <div class="example">
      <p><strong>Coordination</strong><br />
      When “gluing” verbs together with “and” or “or” (known as
      <em>coordination</em>), we find that wanna-contraction fails.</p>
      <ol start="8" class="example" type="1">
      <li><span class="bad">I don’t expect, need, or wanna
      dance.</span></li>
      <li><span class="bad">I don’t wanna or expect to
      dance.</span></li>
      </ol>
      <p>It’s not clear why there would be a silent word blocking this
      contraction.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="example">
      <p><strong>Noun-Form</strong><br />
      There is a noun form of “want”, such as in “my only want is to be
      remembered”. Even when to immediately follows this “want” we don’t
      see any contraction.</p>
      <ol start="10" class="example" type="1">
      <li>We cannot expect that want to be satisfied.</li>
      <li><span class="bad">We cannot expect that wanna be
      satisfied.</span></li>
      </ol>
      <p>I find (11) almost laughable. It’s clear that “want” and “to”
      simply being next to each other isn’t enough for contraction to
      occur.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="example">
      <p><strong>Intransitive Want</strong><br />
      There is an intransitive form of “want”, such as in the sentence
      “I am never satisfied and always wanting”. This form also doesn’t
      seem to contract.</p>
      <ol start="12" class="example" type="1">
      <li><em>(In order)</em> to be an effective over-consumer, you have
      to really want.</li>
      <li>You have to really want <em>(in order)</em> to be an effective
      over-consumer.</li>
      <li>You have to really WANNA be an effective over-consumer.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>You could read (13) without the parentheses, and it would be
      ambiguous — (14), however, is suddenly unambiguous!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="example">
      <p><strong>Parentheticals</strong><br />
      There are also more “random” reasons why “want” and “to” might be
      next to each other, such as in an interjection. In these cases,
      contraction seems to be blocked as well.</p>
      <ol start="15" class="example" type="1">
      <li>I want, to be precise, a yellow four-door De Ville
      convertible.</li>
      <li><span class="bad">I wanna, be precise, a yellow four-door De
      Ville convertible.</span></li>
      </ol>
      </div>
      <p><strong>The old-school answer, that traces are the secret to
      wanna-contraction, just can’t be the whole story!</strong></p>
      <h2 id="a-better-solution">A Better Solution</h2>
      <div class="note">
      <p><strong>Act 3</strong> — An improved answer to the question
      “what are the rules for wanna?”</p>
      </div>
      <p>Those previous examples were noted by <span class="citation"
      data-cites="pullum1997">Pullum (<a href="#ref-pullum1997"
      role="doc-biblioref">1997</a>)</span>, who developed a much more
      convincing solution to our conundrum: <strong>what if “wanna” is
      its own word?</strong></p>
      <p>It isn’t that extreme of a thought! It would certainly explain
      our data! “Wanna” would be its own verb (distinct from “want”),
      which would have its own (equally distinct) behaviors.<a
      href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
      <p>And it’s not uncommon for phrases or contractions to become
      their own words (or <em>lexicalize</em>). Take “don’t” for example
      — native speakers would agree “do not” sounds <em>way</em> scarier
      than “don’t”. It doesn’t matter if we’re speaking slowly or
      quickly, they’re not exactly the same.</p>
      <p>So, just as “do not” and “don’t” are subtly different, maybe
      “want to” and “wanna” are also different (though a bit
      <em>more</em> different).</p>
      <h3 id="the-verb-wanna">The Verb “Wanna”</h3>
      <p>OK, let’s say “wanna” is its own verb… now we have a new
      problem! If “wanna” is a verb, shouldn’t it conjugate like
      one?</p>

      <p>Instead of “wanna” conjugating as if it were its own word,
      conjugation happens at the expanded level. Of course, “wanna”
      could just be irregular, but that seems a bit like cheating.</p>
      <p>This is a problem for the theory that “wanna” is a new word. No
      fears, though — we can make a slight amendment!</p>
      <h3 id="the-to-postfix">The To-Postfix</h3>
      <p>Pullum makes a pretty clever jump: the secret is that
      <strong>“to” isn’t a <em>word</em>, but a <em>morphological
      postfix!</em> </strong>.</p>
      <dl>
      <dt>Postfix</dt>
      <dd>
      A postfix isn’t a word on its own, but something you may attach to
      the end of a word to build a <em>new</em> word.<br />
      <strong>e.g. “Dog” + “-s” = “Dogs”</strong><br />
      While “dogs” is clearly <em>derived</em> from “dog”, it has new
      behavior distinct from the singular “dog”.
      </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>The claim is that “want” may take the postfix “-to” and
      <em>create</em> a new word, with these altered grammatical
      properties! This allows for the conjugation pattern we saw before,
      while maintaining the theory that “wanna” is distinct from
      “want”.</p>
      <p>We should expect the same thing to take place with other verbs
      as well — “to” should attach to some verbs, and modify their
      properties in a consistent way. And lo and behold, such a set of
      verbs exists: the <em>therapy verbs</em>!<a href="#fn6"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
      <div class="row therapy">
      <div class="one-half column">
      <ul>
      <li>want + to <span class="math inline">\(\Rightarrow\)</span>
      <strong>wanna</strong></li>
      <li>used + to <span class="math inline">\(\Rightarrow\)</span>
      <strong>usta</strong></li>
      <li>got + to <span class="math inline">\(\Rightarrow\)</span>
      <strong>gotta</strong></li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="one-half column">
      <ul>
      <li>going + to <span class="math inline">\(\Rightarrow\)</span>
      <strong>gonna</strong></li>
      <li>have + to <span class="math inline">\(\Rightarrow\)</span>
      <strong>hafta</strong></li>
      <li>supposed + to <span class="math inline">\(\Rightarrow\)</span>
      <strong>supposta</strong></li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p>And just as predicted, all of these words are imbued with new
      behaviors, different from that of the expanded forms. Let’s look
      at two examples.</p>
      <div class="example">
      <p><strong>“Going to” VS “Gonna”</strong><br />
      </p>
      <ol start="17" class="example" type="1">
      <li>I’m not going to annoy her.</li>
      <li>I’m not gonna annoy her.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>While (17) has two possible meanings, (18) only has one
      meaning: my full intention of annoying her. Only the “future”
      sense of the word may take the “-to” postfix (and not the
      locative).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="example">
      <p><strong>“Have to” VS “Hafta”</strong><br />
      Similarly, only one sense of “have” may take the “-to” postfix —
      the necessity meaning.</p>
      <ol start="19" class="example" type="1">
      <li>There are some puzzles I have to work on.</li>
      <li>There are some puzzles I hafta work on.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Again we see two possible readings for (19), but only one for
      (20). What’s more, “hafta” follows the same conjugation rules as
      “wanna”:</p>
      <ol start="21" class="example" type="1">
      <li><span class="bad">There are some puzzles she haftas work
      on.</span></li>
      <li><span class="good">There are some puzzles she hasta work
      on</span></li>
      </ol>
      </div>
      <h2 id="parting-notes">Parting Notes</h2>
      <p>So is this the end-all-be-all answer to why “wanna” is such a
      strange beast? Of course not. I’ve completely skipped over the
      morphological rules that might allow “to” to behave this way, and
      they aren’t without controversy. But hopefully, if I’ve convinced
      you of anything, it’s that “wanna” (which we might have thought
      was just our tongues being lazy) is actually a beautiful and
      complex bit of language.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
      <p>If you’re looking for further reading, I <em>highly</em>
      recommend starting off with the Pullum paper -<span
      class="citation" data-cites="pullum1997">Pullum (<a
      href="#ref-pullum1997" role="doc-biblioref">1997</a>)</span>. From
      there, you might be interested in some other work in the area.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Boas looks at “wanna” from a Constructivist viewpoint, a
      totally different linguistic framework. It gives a good view of
      other ways to look at the problem <span class="citation"
      data-cites="boas2004">(<a href="#ref-boas2004"
      role="doc-biblioref">Boas 2004</a>)</span>.</li>
      <li>There is research on how non-native speakers seem to learn
      these rules in ways different from native speakers <span
      class="citation" data-cites="kweon2011">(<a href="#ref-kweon2011"
      role="doc-biblioref">Kweon and Bley-Vroman 2011</a>)</span>.</li>
      <li>Finally, an interesting paper by Zukowski and Larsen point out
      that children seem to use wanna in different ways than adults, and
      casts some doubt on modern thinking of “wanna” <span
      class="citation" data-cites="zukowski2011">(<a
      href="#ref-zukowski2011" role="doc-biblioref">Zukowski and Larsen
      2011</a>)</span>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I’m curious what might have stood out to you? Are you a native
      speaker who didn’t agree with some of these judgments? Or maybe a
      non-native speaker who never noticed how complicated this
      contraction was? Maybe you’re aware of a similarly odd verb class
      in your own language! As always let me know your thoughts, and
      thanks for reading!</p>

      <li id="fn1"><p>I’m being facetious — the linguists were Chomsky
      and his crew, and the school was MIT. They were developing what
      would become <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalist_program">the
      Minimalist Program</a> (sometimes called “MP” for short), which is
      still the most dominant theory (or more accurately “program”) of
      syntax out there. Defining what the minimalist program is far
      beyond the scope of this post — all that really matters right now
      is that <em>movement</em> is a key part of those theories.<a
      href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"
      role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn2"><p>“You like him”, of course, would be a more natural
      sentence. I chose “You do like him” to avoid talking about why
      “do” suddenly appears in a question.<a href="#fnref2"
      class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn3"><p>Traces aren’t the only example of <em>silent
      words</em> — they are just one instance of something known as an
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_category">empty
      category</a>.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back"
      role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn4"><p>I actually chose to skip over another pretty
      important problem — within Chomsky’s own theories there are
      actually <em>other</em> silent words! If you are familiar with the
      <span class="math inline">\(PRO\)</span> category, you may have
      noticed there were elements missing when we were explaining
      movement. A fuller expansion would be <em>“What do you want <span
      class="math inline">\(PRO\)</span> to read <span
      class="math inline">\(t_\text{what}\)</span>”</em>. It seems a bit
      inconsistent that one silent word would block contraction, while
      the other would have no effect.<a href="#fnref4"
      class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn5"><p>Think about the verbs “think” and “wonder”.
      “Think” can take a finite non-question, like in “I think she is
      here.” “Wonder” can take only take question clauses, as in “I
      wonder if she is here.” You couldn’t ever say “I think if she is
      here”! Verbs can be broken down into classes, each with rules
      describing these behaviours.<a href="#fnref5"
      class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn6"><p>Why the name “Therapy Verbs”? To quote Pullum
      “there are surely few of us who have never experienced a conflict
      between their wannas and their haftas.”<a href="#fnref6"
      class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn7"><p>Lt. Commander Data would be the first to tell you
