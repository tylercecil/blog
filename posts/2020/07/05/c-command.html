        <div class="note">
      <strong>Note</strong>: ‘Wait, why are you drawing trees this way?!
      That’s all wrong!!’ Yes, it is all wrong. Because of the
      introductory-nature of this post, I’ve chosen to use very
      over-simplified flat trees. If you know something about syntax, I
      hope you can ignore this, and if you’re wanting to learn why I
      organized the trees I did… maybe don’t! <br>
      <strong>Update</strong>: I’ve improved the Tree rendering with a
      new library I wrote, <a
      href="https://github.com/tylercecil/chomTree">ChomTree</a>! Let me
      know if you notice any bugs!
    </div>
    
    <article>
      <p>I have a puzzle for you: <strong>when would use him/her/them vs
      himself/herself/themselves? Can you ever swap one out for the
      other?</strong></p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Got an answer in your head? Cool!</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In this post, I hope to break whatever answer you came up with,
      and replace it with a surprising yet simple answer! You’ll laugh.
      You’ll cry. And maybe… just maybe, you’ll learn yourself
      something.</p>
      <h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
      <p>First, let’s define some terms. For our purposes there are
      three types of noun phrases:</p>
      <dl>
      <dt>R-Expression</dt>
      <dd>
      Referse to something specific or concrete.<a href="#fn1"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a><br />
      <em>i.e.</em> “The cat”, “Tom”, “My hopes and dreams”
      </dd>
      <dt>Pronoun</dt>
      <dd>
      May (or may not) refere to another NP in the sentence (or
      discourse).<br />
      <em>i.e.</em> he/him, she/her, they/them
      </dd>
      <dt>Anaphor<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></dt>
      <dd>
      <em>Must</em> refere to another NP in the sentence.<br />
      <em>i.e.</em> himself, herself, themselves
      </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Here’s an example to make that a bit more concrete. We’ll use
      an index to mark what each NP could be referring to.</p>
      <ol class="example" type="1">
      <li><span class="i">Jeremy</span> fooled <span
      class="i">himself</span> into thinking <span class="ij">he</span>
      could love another man.</li>
      </ol>
      <table>
      <thead>
      <tr class="header">
      <th style="text-align: left;">NP</th>
      <th style="text-align: left;">Type</th>
      <th style="text-align: left;">Index</th>
      </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
      <tr class="odd">
      <td style="text-align: left;">“Jeremy”</td>
      <td style="text-align: left;">R-Expression</td>
      <td style="text-align: left;"><span
      class="math inline">\(i\)</span></td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="even">
      <td style="text-align: left;">“himself”</td>
      <td style="text-align: left;">Anaphor</td>
      <td style="text-align: left;"><span
      class="math inline">\(i\)</span></td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="odd">
      <td style="text-align: left;">“he”</td>
      <td style="text-align: left;">Pronoun</td>
      <td style="text-align: left;"><span
      class="math inline">\(i\)</span> or <span
      class="math inline">\(j\)</span></td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>Note how “he” could refer to Jeremy (likely how you read it
      without context), <em>or</em> it could refer to some other man,
      like Kyle!</p>
      <ol start="2" class="example" type="1">
      <li><span class="i">Jeremy</span> fooled <span
      class="i">himself</span> into thinking <span class="j">Kyle</span>
      could love another man.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>It’s that flexibility that makes “he” a pronoun, and the lack
      of flexibility “himself” an anaphor.</p>
      <h2 id="the-puzzle">The Puzzle</h2>
      <p>So, let me phrase our riddle a bit more exactly: <strong>what
      syntactic rule governs the distribution<a href="#fn3"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> of pronouns and
      anaphora?</strong></p>
      <h3 id="indexing">Indexing</h3>
      <p>First thing I want to point out that <em>the index
      matters!</em> While a pronoun <em>can</em> refer to multiple
      things, when actually used there is an intended meaning. For
      example…</p>
      <ol start="3" class="example" type="1">
      <li><span class="i">Roberto</span> taught <span
      class="i">himself</span> to fly.<br />
      <span class="i">Roberto</span> taught <span class="j">him</span>
      to fly.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Using “him” to refer to some <span class="math inline">\(j
      \not= i\)</span> works just fine. However, if “him” means
      “Roberto”, things don’t work!</p>
      <ol start="4" class="example" type="1">
      <li><span class="bad"><span class="i">Roberto</span> taught <span
      class="j">himself</span> to fly.</span><br />
      <span class="bad"><span class="i">Roberto</span> taught <span
      class="i">him</span> to fly.</span></li>
      </ol>
      <p>Word for word the sentences in (4) are the exact same sentences
      as (3). But these sentences syntactically cannot match with the
      semantics being expressed. If Roberto has taught himself to fly,
      “Roberto taught him to fly” just doesn’t communicate the right
      idea!</p>
      <p>It’s also worth pointing out that duplicating the R-Expression
      is also unnatural:</p>
      <ol start="5" class="example" type="1">
      <li><span class="bad"><span class="i">Roberto</span> taught <span
      class="i">Roberto</span> to fly.</span><br />
      <span class="i">Roberto</span> taught <span
      class="j">Roberto</span> to fly. (Two men named “Roberto”)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>So, whatever rule we come up with, it’s going to have to keep
      the indices in mind!</p>
      <h3 id="word-order">Word Order</h3>
      <p>Ok, maybe you came up with a rule like this:</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>“If a noun follows another noun, and they share indices, an
      anaphor must be used.”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ol start="6" class="example" type="1">
      <li><span class="i">He</span> taught <span class="j">Robert</span>
      to fly.<br />
      <span class="bad"><span class="i">He</span> taught <span
      class="i">Robert</span> to fly.</span><br />
      <span class="i">He</span> taught <span class="i">himself</span> to
      fly.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Seems reasonable, but it’s a little too simple. Remember (1)?
      This was a totally valid reading:</p>
      <ol start="7" class="example" type="1">
      <li><span class="i">Jeremy</span> fooled <span
      class="i">himself</span> into thinking <span class="i">he</span>
      could love another man.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><span class="i">He</span> followed <span
      class="i">himself</span> here, yet <span class="bad">“Jeremy
      fooled himself into thinking himself could love another
      man”</span> certainly didn’t work.<a href="#fn4"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>“Ok… if the last noun was an R-Expression with the same
      index…”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <ol start="8" class="example" type="1">
      <li><span class="j">[<span class="i">[Heidi]</span>’s
      mother]</span> bopped <span class="j">herself</span> on the head
      with a zucchini.<br />
      <span class="bad"><span class="j">[<span
      class="i">[Heidi]</span>’s mother]</span> bopped <span
      class="i">herself</span> on the head with a zucchini.</span><br />
      <span class="j">[<span class="i">[Heidi]</span>’s mother]</span>
      bopped <span class="i">her</span> on the head with a
      zucchini.<br />
      <span class="bad"><span class="j">[<span
      class="i">[Heidi]</span>’s mother]</span> bopped <span
      class="j">her</span> on the head with a zucchini.</span> <span
      class="citation" data-cites="carnie2013">(<a
      href="#ref-carnie2013" role="doc-biblioref">Carnie 2013, chap.
      5</a>)</span></li>
      </ol>
      <p>Not bad, but what about this:</p>
      <ol start="9" class="example" type="1">
      <li><span class="j">[The mother of <span
      class="i">[Heidi]</span>]</span> bopped <span
      class="j">herslef</span> on the head with a zucchini.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In (9), Heidi was the most recent R-Expression! Whatever rule
      we come up with, we’re going to need a bit more structure…</p>
      <h3 id="subject-object-relationship">Subject-Object
      Relationship</h3>
      <p>You might know anaphora as “reflexive-pronouns”, so maybe you
      gave a rule like</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>“If the object of a verb shares an index with the subject, an
      anaphor must be used. Otherwise, it can never be used.”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This is a pretty good rule, but unfortunately it <em>under
      generates</em> (meaning anaphora get used in more places than this
      rule would suggest). Consider:</p>
      <ol start="10" class="example" type="1">
      <li><span class="i">She</span> told me all about <span
      class="i">herself</span>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>“About herself” is a prepositional phrase, not exactly an
      object! We’re close though… One thing that seems to be true — if
      an anaphor <em>can</em> be used, it <em>must</em> be used.</p>
      <p>Alright, enough playing around, let’s take a more structured
      look at things!</p>
      <h2 id="c-command">C-Command</h2>
      <p>Our solution is going to be rooted in the tree structure of our
      sentences. Often with trees we use relationships like “parent”,
      “child”, “sibling”, “cousin”, etc… The relationship we need here
      is just a tad richer — <em>c-command</em>.</p>
      <dl>
      <dt>C-Command</dt>
      <dd>
      <em>(Informal)</em> Node A c-commands its siblings and all of
      their decendents.<br />
      <em>(Formal)</em> Node A c-commands node B if every node branching
      dominating A also dominates B, and neither A nor B dominates the
      other.
      </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>To get a feel for this relationship, here is a very simple
      syntax tree<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. Click on any node, and it
      will show which nodes that node c-commands!</p>
      <div class="tree">
      <p>[TP [NP [D The] [AdjP.Adj big] [Adj fat] [N man]] [VP [AdvP.Adv
      quickly] [V eats] [NP [AdjP.Adj tasty] [N cake.]]]]</p>
      </div>
      <p>In the formal definition I have to note that we calculate
      siblings from the first “branching” ancestor. For example, in the
      above sentence you might notice that “The” c-commands all nodes in
      the NP, even though it technically has no siblings. It’s like we
      skip-over D, and go strait to the NP root.</p>
      <p>Now that we understand the c-command relationship, we should be
      able to come up with a solution to our puzzle!</p>
      <h2 id="binding-principals">Binding Principals</h2>
      <p>Let’s look at the tree for (8).</p>
      <div class="tree">
      <p>[TP [NP [DP [N Heidi] [Gen ’s]] [N mother]] [VP [V bopped]
      [NP.N herself] [PP [P on] [NP [D the] [N head]]] [PP [P with] [NP
      [D a] [N zucchini]]]]]</p>
      </div>
      <p>Now, we have a few notes we can make here:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The NP “Heidi’s mother” c-commands the entire VP.</li>
      <li>The N “Heidi” doesn’t c-command the VP.</li>
      <li>“Herself” doesn’t c-command the subject phrase.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We can use this information to come up with a pretty good set
      of rules! First, to make our definitions a bit more clear, we
      should define the term “syntactic binding”.</p>
      <dl>
      <dt>Binding</dt>
      <dd>
      A binds B if A c-commands B, and A and B share the same
      index.<br />
      We say A is the <strong>binder</strong> and B is the
      <strong>bindee</strong>.<br />
      If A is unbound, we call it <strong>free</strong>.
      </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Now, <em>finally</em>, let’s look at our rules!</p>
      <dl>
      <dt>The Binding Principals</dt>
      <dd>
      <strong>Anaphor:</strong> An Anaphor must be bound.<br />
      <strong>Pronoun:</strong> A pronoun must be free.<br />
      <strong>R-Expression:</strong> An R-Expression must be free.
      </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Look back at our examples thus far, and see if they work
      out!</p>
      <h3 id="binding-domain">Binding Domain</h3>
      <p>These binding principals describe things fairly well, solving
      the problems we’ve seen thus far, but it needs one little
      revision! Let’s look back at our first example</p>
      <ol start="11" class="example" type="1">
      <li><span class="i">Jeremy</span> fooled <span
      class="i">himself</span> into thinking <span class="ij">he</span>
      could love another man.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>“Jeremy” is certainly free. “Himself” bound. But what about
      “he”? It looks like “he” could be bound, or not, yet “he” seems to
      be ok in both cases! To address this, we add one last idea — a
      binding domain. Because “he could love another man” is its own
      clause, we say “Jeremy” is outside the binding domain of “he”.</p>
      <p>It’s as if, when choosing between “he” or “himself”, we only
      look at the tree for that clause:</p>
      <div class="tree">
      <p>[TP [NP.N he] [T could] [VP [V love] [NP [D another] [N
      man]]]]</p>
      </div>
      <p>In this <em>subtree</em>, “he” is free, even though it is
      <em>bound</em> outside of this clause.</p>
      <p>At the same time, R-Expressions don’t seem to have this binding
      domain!</p>
      <ol start="12" class="example" type="1">
      <li><span class="bad"><span class="i">Jeremy</span> fooled <span
      class="i">himself</span> into thinking <span
      class="i">Jeremy</span> could love another man.</span></li>
      </ol>
      <p>With all of this, we can revise our answer, and come up with a
      final rule.</p>
      <dl>
      <dt>The Binding Principals (Revised)</dt>
      <dd>
      <strong>Anaphor:</strong> An Anaphor must be bound in its binding
      domain.<br />
      <strong>Pronoun:</strong> A pronoun must be free in its binding
      domain.<br />
      <strong>R-Expression:</strong> An R-Expression must be globaly
      free.
      </dd>
      </dl>
      <p><strong>That, my friends, is our answer!</strong></p>
      <h3 id="does-this-cover-everything">Does this Cover
      Everything?</h3>
      <p>You may have found some examples which don’t seem to fit our
      definition. For example, sentences such as “she read the letter
      <em>herself”</em>. It turns out this isn’t as much of a problem,
      as this usage of”herself” is, in fact, acting as an adverb / focus
      particle, and not actually a noun phrase. In some languages, this
      focus particle would actually be a different word (“sie hat es
      selbst gelessen” and not <span class="bad">“sie hat es sich
      gelessen”</span>).</p>
      <p>There are also some problems with our idea of binding domain,
      which muddies the waters a bit — clarifying it, however, would
      require some background in <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_movement">movement</a>,
      which I don’t want to get into.</p>
      <h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
      <p>Early in my introduction to linguistics I learned about the
      <em>c-command</em> relationship, only being told it was “very
      important” (which I didn’t find to be particularly helpful).
      Binding, however, was when I realized it really was important!</p>
      <p>Binding is a very well developed theory, and in fact <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_and_binding_theory">Government
      and Binding Theory</a> was an early form of <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalist_program">The
      Minmalist Program</a> (the current dominant theoretical program in
      Transformational Grammar). For an introduction to how binding
      operates in these frameworks, I’d recomend <span class="citation"
      data-cites="chomsky1980">Chomsky (<a href="#ref-chomsky1980"
      role="doc-biblioref">1980</a>)</span> (but be warned, this paper
      is very technical). <span class="citation"
      data-cites="higginbotham1980">Higginbotham (<a
      href="#ref-higginbotham1980" role="doc-biblioref">1980</a>)</span>
      gives a similar (and a bit more accessible) introduction to the
      idea, which only focuses on the uses we touched on here. While
      Higginbotham uses complex theories of movement, I think the paper
      is at least skimable to the beginner.</p>
      <p>For a lighter introduction, I learned about binding from my
      first syntax book, <span class="citation"
      data-cites="carnie2013">Carnie (<a href="#ref-carnie2013"
      role="doc-biblioref">2013, chaps. 5, 17</a>)</span>. For someone
      new to linguistics (which… if you just read this post, that’s
      probably you) I would strongly recommend that book.</p>
      <p>Thanks for reading! Let me know if something didn’t makes
      sense! I’d be curious how these rules fit within your own
      languages!</p>

      kinda</a>… but that’s not the point right now!<a href="#fnref1"

      <li id="fn2"><p>I’ve used the word anaphor in my post on <a
      href="/posts/2020/03/10/b-winograd.html">Winograd schema</a>. I
      have to admit, I think I may have been using it incorrectly /
      confusingly. Consider this an updated definition.<a href="#fnref2"
      class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn3"><p>“Governs the distribution” might sound a bit
      technical, but it’s nothing special. The “distribution” of a class
      of words defines, syntactically, where they occur. For example,
      “adjectives are placed before nouns”.<a href="#fnref3"
      class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn4"><p>You might have noticed that “himself” doesn’t work
      well here, because it is the <strong>nominative case</strong>.
      That is, we have “he” and “him” in English, but not “heself” and
      “himself”. Therefore, you would certainly be right if you noted
      “an anaphor may never be nominative”.<a href="#fnref4"
      class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn5"><p>Why did I draw this tree as I did? In fact, these
      are very over-simplified, and would universally be considered
      wrong. There’s a rich conversation about what the structure of
      these trees should be. What I’ve drawn here is something you might
      see in an intro to linguistics course (specifically with flat
      trees, rather than binary trees). For more information maybe read
      up on the (now outmoded) <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-bar_theory">X-bar theory</a>
      — that’s a good place to start.<a href="#fnref5"
