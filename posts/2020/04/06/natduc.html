      <p>Mathematical logic, despite being a bit obscure, gets used by a
      lot of other fields. A computer scientist, linguist, and
      philosopher could conceivably be reading something, and suddenly
      greeted by a mash of symbols like so</p>
      <p><span class="math display">\[
      \dfrac { \dfrac{ \dfrac{ \dfrac{}{A}u \quad \dfrac{}{B}w }
                             {A \wedge B} \wedge_I }
                     {B \to A \wedge B} \to_{I^w}}
             { A \to B \to A \wedge B } \to_{I^u}
      \]</span></p>
      <p>The thing is, that same computer scientist, linguist, or
      philosopher could have just as likely never taken a course on
      formal logic before, and might have just audibly groaned out
      <em>“oooh nooo”.</em> They might not even know how to Google what
      the hell they’re looking at right now.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Well I’ll tell you what you’re looking at — that’s called a
      <strong>natural deduction proof</strong>, and it’s nothing you
      need to be afraid of.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This post is for anyone in one of these logic-adjacent fields
      (or anyone bored in COVID-Quarantine™) who might be new to this
      notation. We’ll cover:</p>

      <p>As always, skip over what you know, jump to what’s new, skim
      liberally — and this time I’ve included some exercises to play
      around with! <strong>Now let’s get to it!</strong></p>
      <h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
      <p>It’s probably important to understand <em>why</em> natural
      deduction was invented, or we’d just be talking about some random
      symbols with no context. Natural deduction is a particular
      notation used in a field known as <strong>proof
      theory</strong>.</p>
      <dl>
      <dt>Proof Theory</dt>
      <dd>
      At a high level, proof theory is the mathematical study of <em>how
      we come to conclusions.</em><br />
      <strong>For example:</strong> what would cause one to conclude
      <em>“the pope is catholic and water is wet”?</em> Well, first you
      would need to conclude both <em>“the pope is catholic”</em>
      <strong>and</strong> <em>“water is wet”</em>. It sounds obvious,
      but the goal here is to break down the obvious to give us incite
      into the not-so-obvious.
      </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>So where does natural deduction fit into proof theory? Because
      proof theory is the <em>mathematical</em> study of
      conclusion-making, it is highly structured. Natural deduction is
      one of those structures, known as a <strong>formal proof
      system</strong> or a <strong>proof calculus</strong>.</p>
      <dl>
      <dt>Proof Calculus</dt>
      <dd>
      A proof calculus is a set of rules that describe how one can go
      from a set of assumptions (called <strong>axioms</strong>) to some
      conclusion.<br />
      It is called “formal” because these rules are syntactic — that is,
      they only tell us how to move symbols around. We should be able to
      “mindlessly” read a formal proof, without making jumps of
      conclusions on our own.
      </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Natural deduction, developed by the German mathematician
      Gerhard Gentzen in 1934, is what some might call “kinda a big
      deal”. It<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> rendered older proof calculi<a
      href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> totally obsolete and has
      really been the gold standard ever since.</p>
      <p>Gentzen style systems can also be called
      <strong>structural/analytic proofs</strong>. Normally in math, you
      write a proof <em>about</em> some mathematical object. In a
      <em>structural proof</em>, the proof itself <em>is</em> a
      mathematical object. What the heck does that mean? We can ask
      questions like <em>“is proof 1 equal to proof 2?”</em> or <em>“can
      proof 1 combine with proof 2?”</em> Now we can <strong>study the
      proofs themselves.</strong></p>
      <p>It is this structural property that makes Gentzen systems
      useful for computer scientists, linguists, and philosophers. For
      today, though, all we really need to know is <strong>natural
      deduction is a formal system for studying how we come to
      conclusions.</strong></p>
      <h2 id="reading-natural-deduction">Reading Natural Deduction</h2>
      <p>To read a natural deduction proof, we ultimately only need to
      know two things: what is a judgment, and what is an inference.</p>
      <h3 id="judgment-and-inference">Judgment and Inference</h3>
      <dl>
      <dt>Judgment</dt>
      <dd>
      A Judgment is anything that is <em>knowable</em>. A judgment <span
      class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> might be formal, such as
      <em>“<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is true”</em>, or
      informal, such as <em>“Matha is in love”</em>.
      </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>That is meant to be as vague as possible. You may want to judge
      the type of a program, the veracity of a mathematical statement,
      or the meaning of a sentence in Navajo.</p>
      <dl>
      <dt>The Inference Line</dt>
      <dd>
      Let <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> and <span
      class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> be judgements. We read <span
      class="math inline">\(\cfrac{\Gamma}{\Delta}\)</span> as
      <em>“<span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> can be inferred
      from <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span>”.</em> <span
      class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span> is referred to as the
      <strong>premise</strong>, <span
      class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> as the
      <strong>conclusion</strong>, and the line as the <strong>inference
      line</strong>. There might be zero or more premises, and always
      one conclusion.
      </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Now reading these trees becomes pretty easy! Remember, we are
      trying to capture the essence of what it means to draw a
      conclusion.</p>
      <div class="example">
      <table>
      <colgroup>
      <col style="width: 47%" />
      <col style="width: 52%" />
      </colgroup>
      <thead>
      <tr class="header">
      <th>Proof Tree</th>
      <th>English Interpretation</th>
      </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
      <tr class="odd">
      <td><span class="math display">\[ \cfrac{ \;A \quad B\; }
               { A \texttip{\bbox[3px, border:1px dotted
      grey]{\wedge}}{&quot;and&quot;} B}
      \]</span></td>
      <td><strong>Premise:</strong> <span
      class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is known and <span
      class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is known.<br />
      <strong>Conclusion:</strong> <span class="math inline">\(A \wedge
      B\)</span> can be concluded.</td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>This is exactly our example from before! Let <span
      class="math inline">\(A\)</span> be <em>“the pope is
      Catholic”</em> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> be
      <em>“water is wet”</em>. Because you know <span
      class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
      class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, you <em>could conclude</em> the
      sentence <em>“the pope is Catholic and water is wet”</em>.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Once we can read that example, you might see how we might stack
      these little proofs, to follow a longer “though process”.</p>
      <div class="example">
      <table>
      <colgroup>
      <col style="width: 47%" />

      <tr class="odd">

                      { A \wedge B }

               {A \wedge B \wedge C}
      \]</span></td>
      <td>I know <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
      class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, and therefor could conclude
      <span class="math inline">\(A \wedge B\)</span>. Now I know <span
      class="math inline">\(A \wedge B\)</span>, but I also know <span
      class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. Finally I can conclude <span
      class="math inline">\(A \wedge B \wedge C\)</span>.</td>
      </tr>

      <h3 id="introduction-and-elimination">Introduction and
      Elimination</h3>
      <p>OK, now that we can read the “flow” of a natural deduction
      proof, we need to ask ourselves <strong>“what conclusions are
      legal?”</strong> This isn’t ’Nam, there are rules!</p>
      <p>We will call those rules our <strong>introduction and
      elimination rules</strong>. The example we’ve been playing with so
      far revolves around the word <em>“and”</em> (which I’m going to
      refer to as <em>conjunction</em>). To explain what introduction
      and elimination rules are, why don’t we take a look at the rules
      for conjunction!</p>
      <table>
      <caption>The introduction and elimination rules for
      <em>conjunction.</em> The symbol to the right of each inference
      line is the name of the rule being defined.</caption>
      <colgroup>
      <col style="width: 28%" />
      <col style="width: 71%" />
      </colgroup>
      <tbody>
      <tr class="odd">
      <td><span class="math inline">\(\cfrac{A \quad B}  {A \wedge B}
      \wedge_I\)</span></td>
      <td><strong>Introduction Rule</strong><br />
      If I know <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
      class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, I may conclude <span
      class="math inline">\(A \wedge B\)</span>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="even">
      <td><span class="math inline">\(\cfrac{A \wedge B}  {A}
      \wedge_{E1}\)</span></td>
      <td><strong>Elimination Rule 1</strong><br />
      If I know <span class="math inline">\(A \wedge B\)</span>, I may
      conclude <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="odd">
      <td><span class="math inline">\(\cfrac{A \wedge B}  {B}
      \wedge_{E2}\)</span></td>
      <td><strong>Elimination Rule 2</strong><br />
      If I know <span class="math inline">\(A \wedge B\)</span>, I may
      conclude <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>.</td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
      </table>
      <p><strong>These three rules together define how conjunction
      works</strong>. In fact, every word/symbol/operator in our system
      will be defined by a set of rules. The introduction rules defined
      <strong>when we can add the word “and” into a conclusion</strong>
      (namely when we know two things). The elimination rules defined
      <strong>what simpler conclusions we can draw from a sentence with
      conjunction</strong>.</p>
      <p>Some might find those elimination rules confusing, so let me
      give a very short English explanation.</p>
      <div class="example">
      <p><strong>Elimination Rule Explanation</strong></p>
      <p>Let’s say I told you <em>“the pope is Catholic, and water is
      wet”</em>. What could you conclude from that (other than I am
      clearly a conversational master)?</p>
      <p>The answer is very little! You could, however, conclude “the
      pope is Catholic”. By doing that, we’ve “eliminated” the “and”
      part of the sentence, and are left with a simpler idea!</p>
      </div>
      <p>Alright, now it’s your turn!</p>
      <div class="example">
      <p><strong>Question:</strong> What are the <em>Introduction
      Rules</em> for disjunction?<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"

      </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>That is, simply knowing either <span
      class="math inline">\(A\)</span> or <span
      class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is sufficient for knowing <span
      class="math inline">\(A \vee B\)</span>.</p>
      <p>For example, how could you come to the conclusion <em>“the pope
      is Catholic <em>or</em> water is dry”?</em> Well just knowing “the
      pope is Catholic” is enough!</p>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p>Now what about the <em>Elimination Rule</em> for <span
      class="math inline">\(\vee\)</span>? Can you come up with an
      English explanation of the rule? To write the rule down formally,
      we need one last bit of notation.</p>
      <h3 id="hypotheticals">Hypotheticals</h3>
      <p>What’s missing is we have no way of working with “hypothetical
      situations”. Something like <em>“if <span
      class="math inline">\(A\)</span> were true (and I’m not saying it
      is), <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> would
      follow”.</em></p>
      <dl>
      <dt>Hypothetical</dt>
      <dd>
      A hypothetical premise <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span>
      is written as so: <span class="math display">\[ \cfrac{}{\Gamma}
      x\]</span> Where <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is a
      number unique for this hypothetical situation.
      </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Now we can write down an Elimination Rule for disjunction!<a

      <p><strong>Disjuction Elimination Example</strong></p>
      <p>What conclusion could I draw, if I knew <em>“Simon is either
      the Pope, or he goes to church every week”</em>? In this case, I
      don’t know if either half of this sentence alone is true.</p>

      <h2 id="lambda-calculus">Lambda Calculus</h2>
      <p>There are a glut of reasons why you might run into a natural
      deduction proof. Philosophers and linguists alike have been
      interested in trying to break down exactly how our reasoning
      processes seem to operate. Computer science’s tie to logic is
      rather obvious — often the semantics of programming languages are
      described in terms of natural deduction inferences, for example.
      And ever since Montague, Linguists have been using logic to model
      semantics, and the study of syntax can be just as formal and
      logical.</p>
      <p>In each of these cases, there’s another formal tool, which is a
      bit more common place — the <span
      class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>-calculus!<a href="#fn9"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a> And as it happens,
      <strong>natural deduction and the <span
      class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>-calculus are more similar
      than meets the eyes!</strong></p>
      <p>There is this idea known as <strong>the Curry-Howard
      correspondence</strong>, which very loosely says one can convert
      between a proof and a program (meaning a lambda term, in this
      case). Here, I want to look at the most simple case of how this
      works, using only simply typed <span
      class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>-calculus.</p>
      <h3 id="simply-type-proofs">Simply Type Proofs</h3>
      <p>In simply typed <span
      class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>-calculus we write <span
      class="math inline">\(x : A \to B\)</span> to mean <em>“the
      element <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is of type <span
      class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to <span
      class="math inline">\(B\)</span>”.</em> Well this “<span
      class="math inline">\(\to\)</span>” is, in fact, the same “<span
      class="math inline">\(\to\)</span>” we’ve been looking at in
      natural deduction!</p>
      <p>Let’s take a pretty meaty example, and break it down together.
      It might take you a bit with a pen and paper to get it all, but
      don’t worry, you have all the time in the world! I won’t be giving
      a test.</p>
      <p>Let’s start with two pre-defined terms <span
      class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and <span
      class="math inline">\(N\)</span>.</p>
      <p><span class="math display">\[

        &amp;N: (A \to E) \to C\\
      \end{align*}
      \]</span></p>
      <p>Using only those two terms, can you write a lambda expression
      of type <span class="math inline">\((B \to E) \to D\)</span>?
      Probably you can! But let me change the question…</p>

      <li>A tree using the <span class="math inline">\(\to_E\)</span>

      <p><strong>We’ve converted a proof from assumptions to conclusions
      into a program from input to output.</strong> Implication
      introduction is the same as creating a function, and implication
      elimination is the same as function application!</p>
      <div class="example">
      <p><strong>Question:</strong> Can you convert the rest of this
      proof into a lambda term? For our starting assumptions, use the
      <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> and <span
      class="math inline">\(N\)</span> terms we started with.</p>

      <p>For more practice, try converting the other exercises in this
      post! You’ll need to think a bit about how you might treat <span
      class="math inline">\(\wedge\)</span> and <span
      class="math inline">\(\vee\)</span>, though…</p>

      </div>
      <p>Now if you’re thinking to yourself, “Tyler… it would have been
      <em>way</em> easier to just write the lambda terms without any of
      this gobbledygook.”</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Yes, that might be true! But it works the other way, too!</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>You could write a lambda expression, and convert it
      back to a proof</strong>. The key takeaway here is
      <strong>judgments are types, and proofs are programs!</strong> I
      can tell we all have a little smoke coming out of our ears right
      now, so why don’t I just leave it at that.</p>
      <p>If you’d like to learn more about the Curry-Howard
      correspondence, drop a comment! I’d be happy to flesh these ideas
      out more. In the meantime, though, I can point you all to some
      further resources.</p>

      <p>I know this was a long post, but it was also very elementary. I
      just wanted to set people up to be able to access and understand
      other introductory resources on proof theory, natural deduction
      notation, and related things.</p>
      <p>From here, I would <em>highly</em> recommend three

      <li id="fn1"><p>I’m actually lying to you right now — natural
      deduction has a brother called <strong>the sequent
      calculus</strong> which is <em>really</em> the gold standard. It’s
      relatively similar, though, so no worries. At the end of this post
      I’ll link to some resources on the sequent calculus.<a
      href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"
      role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn2"><p>What were these older proof calculi, and what was
      bad about them? They are usually referred to as <em>“Hilbert
      Systems”,</em> and probably the most famous such system was the
      one in <em>Principia Mathematica</em>. The main difference between
      a Gentzen system and a Hilbert system was that a Hilbert system
      preferred to used <em>axioms</em> instead of <em>inference
      rules</em> (don’t worry if you don’t understand that — you should
      probably just learn natural deduction first). That made them a bit
      difficult to deal with, which is why it took <a
      href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=umhistmath&amp;cc=umhistmath&amp;idno=aat3201.0001.001&amp;frm=frameset&amp;view=image&amp;seq=401">Principia
      379 pages to get to “1 + 1 = 2”.</a><a href="#fnref2"
      class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn3"><p><em>Disjunction</em>, of course, means “logical
      or”. In English, reading <span class="math inline">\(A  \vee
      B\)</span> would read as “<span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>
      and/or <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>”.<a href="#fnref3"
      class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn4"><p>Did you notice we called the rule <span
      class="math inline">\(\vee_{E^{1,2}}\)</span>? The “1,2” is there
      to note that “this rule used hypothetical situations 1 and 2”.
      That way we can keep track of what each hypothetical situation is
      doing.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back"
      role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn5"><p>Implication, written as <span
      class="math inline">\(A \to B\)</span>, means “<em>knowing <span
      class="math inline">\(A\)</span> leads to <span
      class="math inline">\(B\)</span>“.</em><a href="#fnref5"
      class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn6"><p>You might be asking me, “isn’t this just Boolean
      Algebra, but hard? Can’t I just write out a truth table to do
      this? We could actual define much more complicated rules for
      things like <span class="math inline">\(\forall\)</span> and <span
      class="math inline">\(\exists\)</span> (and even more!) that a
      truth table would never be able to deal with. For now, though, I
      just wanted to keep things simple.<a href="#fnref6"
      class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn7"><p>Wait, another way to say <em>“from <span
      class="math inline">\(x\)</span> we conclude <span
      class="math inline">\(y\)</span>”</em>, you ask? Don’t get too
      caught up in this right now. I’m only going to use this notation
      to ask the question “can you prove this?” for the moment.<a
      href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back"
      role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn8"><p>Have you noticed how a hypothetical like <span
      class="math inline">\(\overline{A}^1\)</span> and an implication
      like <span class="math inline">\(A \to B\)</span> seem to capture
      almost the same idea? Just, a proof from <span
      class="math inline">\(\overline{A}^1\)</span> to <span
      class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is a <em>reason</em> why you
      would conclude <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> from <span
      class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(A
      \to B\)</span> is the sentence “I have a reason to conclude <span
      class="math inline">\(B\)</span> from <span
      class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.”<a href="#fnref8"
      class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn9"><p>Don’t know what <span
      class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>-calculus is? Then this
      section isn’t for you! Consider reading a good introduction on the
      subject like <a
