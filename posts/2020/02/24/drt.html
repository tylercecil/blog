      <h1>Donkey Sentences</h1>
      <p>The Limits of Lexical Scope</p>
      <p><small>Posted on 2020-02-24</small></p>
          </header>

    
    <article>
      <div style="display:none;">
      <p><span
      class="math inline">\(\newcommand{drs}[2]{  \begin{array}{|c|}  \hline  #1
      \\\hline  #2 \\\hline  \end{array}}\)</span></p>
      </div>
      <p>In semantics, we typically take a sentence, and convert it into
      a formal logical representation.<a href="#fn1"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> <em>“All dogs bark”</em> might
      be represented as <em><span class="math inline">\([\forall
      x\)</span> : DOG<span class="math inline">\((x)]\)</span>
      BARK<span class="math inline">\((x)\)</span>.</em> Formal logical
      systems tend to use <strong>lexical scope</strong> — “<span
      class="math inline">\(\forall\)</span>” introduces an <span
      class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, some things are said about <span
      class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, and then we throw the <span
      class="math inline">\(x\)</span> away.</p>
      <p>My background is in PL Theory, so this makes me feel pretty
      warm and fuzzy inside. But… this might be a case of trying to fit
      a round peg into a square hole, as can be demonstrated by a man
      and his donkey:</p>
      <ol class="example" type="1">
      <li><span class="n1">Russell</span> saw a <span
      class="n2">donkey</span>. <span class="n1">He</span> smiled at
      <span class="n2">it</span>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>We could be lazy, and just say <span class="n1">he</span> and
      <span class="n2">it</span> come from “context”, and leave it at
      that. But even then, what does this look like in a logical
      representation?</p>
      <p><span class="math display">\[
      \begin{align*}
        [\exists x : \text{DONKEY}(x) ]\; &amp;\text{SEE}(r, x)\\
        [\exists x : \text{DONKEY}(x) ]\; &amp;\text{SMILE}(r, x)\\
      \end{align*}
      \]</span></p>
      <p>That obviously doesn’t work, because the donkey Russell saw was
      the same one he smiled at. Maybe we could “merge” these sentences
      together?</p>
      <p><span class="math display">\[
      [\exists x : \text{DONKEY}(x) ]\; \text{SEE}(r, x) \wedge
      \text{SMILE}(r, x)
      \]</span></p>
      <p>But why did the scope of “<span
      class="math inline">\(\exists\)</span>” extend to the next
      sentence? What if we put a sentence between the two? And we still
      haven’t dealt with <span class="n1">he</span> and <span
      class="n2">it</span>!</p>
      <p>This week I want to dive into so-called <em>Donkey
      Sentences</em>, and the advantages of tossing lexical-scope out
      the window, using a technique known as <strong>Discourse
      Representation Theory</strong>, or <strong>DRT</strong>.</p>
      <h2 id="anaphora">Anaphora</h2>
      <blockquote>
      <p><em>Did you just say “Donkey Sentences?”</em></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Why yes I did — <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_sentence">they’re a
      thing</a>! Donkey sentences are totally correct sentences, that
      have clear meanings, but have one small problem: they use
      <em>anaphora</em>.</p>
      <dl>
      <dt>Anaphora</dt>
      <dd>
      Any expression whose interpretation depends on another expression
      elsewhere (called the <strong>antecedent</strong> if it occurred
      before, <strong>postcedent</strong> if it occurred after).<br />
      e.g. “<span class="n1">The president was there</span>, and <span
      class="n1"><strong>that</strong></span> made everyone
      uncomfortable.” The meaning of <span class="n1">that</span>
      depends on the antecedent <span class="n1">the president was
      there</span>.
      </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>So in (1) the anaphora were <span class="n1">he</span> and
      <span class="n2">it</span>.</p>
      <p>When I say <em>“depends on”</em>, what do I mean exactly? At
      first glance, you might think you can simply cut-and-past anaphora
      out of a sentence.</p>
      <ol start="2" class="example" type="1">
      <li><span class="n1">Russell</span> woke up. <span
      class="n1">He</span> was surprised to see <span
      class="n1">his</span> donkey.</li>
      <li><em>Russell</em> was surprised to see <em>Russell’s</em>
      donkey.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>That would make our life easy, but the simple solution of (3)
      doesn’t always work. Trying the same method on (1):</p>
      <ol start="4" class="example" type="1">
      <li>Russell saw a donkey. <em>Russell</em> smiled at <em>a
      donkey</em>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This isn’t exactly the same sentence — it’s not clear that
      we’re talking about the same donkey.<a href="#fn2"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> It’s also worth mentioning
      that anaphora don’t just extend across sentences, but can happen
      within sentences, too!</p>
      <ol start="5" class="example" type="1">
      <li>If <span class="n1">Russell</span> had <span class="n2">a
      donkey</span>, <span class="n1">he</span> would beat <span
      class="n2">it</span>.</li>
      <li>If Russell had a donkey, <em>Russell</em> would beat <em>a
      donkey</em>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Yeah, that’s just no good.</p>
      <p>An interesting note here, is cutting-and-pasting the word
      “Russell” seems to be just fine; it’s this “a donkey” that’s
      causing problems. Let’s keep this in the back of our minds for
      now.</p>
      <h3 id="not-just-nouns">Not just Nouns!</h3>
      <p>It’s worth pointing out there there are <em>all kinds</em> of
      anaphora, not just pronouns. These (and others) all occur
      cross-linguistically.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
      <table>

      during the party.)</td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
      </table>
      <h2 id="scope-woes">Scope Woes</h2>
      <p>So why was it that “Russell” could be copied-and-pasted in
      sentences like (4) and (6), but “a donkey” couldn’t? Looking back
      at the logical representation, we have</p>
      <p><span class="math display">\[
      [\exists x : \text{DONKEY}(x) ]\; \text{SEE}(r, x)
      \]</span></p>
      <p>We converted “a donkey” into <span
      class="math inline">\([\exists x : \text{DONKEY}(x) ]\)</span>,
      which is pretty reasonable. However, this commits us to a scope
      for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> — outside this <span
      class="math inline">\(\exists\)</span>-expression, <span
      class="math inline">\(x\)</span> will be thrown out.</p>
      <p>Russell, on the other hand, was simply assigned to <span
      class="math inline">\(r\)</span>. <span
      class="math inline">\(r\)</span> has no quantifier, and therefore
      no scope. Russell is “global” — there is only one (relevant)
      Russell to speak of, and we can put him wherever we like in our
      sentences.</p>
      <p>And that’s the main difference: Russell isn’t giving us any
      trouble, because <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> has no
      scope. “A donkey”, however, is confusing because <strong>it’s not
      clear how big the scope of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>
      should be.</strong></p>
      <h3 id="dynamic-scoping">Dynamic Scoping</h3>
      <p>Here’s a hot take: <strong>language is stateful.</strong> When
      I say something about a donkey, you don’t just throw it away once
      the sentence is over. Maybe this donkey will make an appearance
      later on down the road — who’s to say? You incrementally keep a
      model of what is being said. This is so intuitive, it borders on
      obvious, yet trying to fit language into lexical scope is wilfully
      ignoring this reality!</p>
      <p>This was the intuition of <span class="citation"
      data-cites="kamp81">Kamp (<a href="#ref-kamp81"
      role="doc-biblioref">1981</a>)</span>, and it caused him to
      develop <strong>Discourse Representation Theory</strong>. At its
      core, <em>DRT</em> and systems like it involve keeping track of a
      <strong>dynamic scope</strong>.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
      <p>Let’s see what this actually looks like.</p>
      <h2 id="drt">DRT</h2>
      <p><em>DRT</em> revolves around the idea of a <em>Discourse
      Representation Structure</em>.</p>
      <dl>
      <dt>Discourse Representation Structure (DRS)</dt>
      <dd>
      <p>A structure made up of two lists:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>A list of <em>discourse referents</em> (the things being
      talked about)</li>
      <li>A list of the <em>conditions</em> (what is being said about
      them)<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></li>
      </ul>
      </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>As sentences are received, the <em>DRT</em> becomes updated.
      Let’s start with the first half of our original sentence.</p>
      <ol start="7" class="example" type="1">
      <li>Russell saw a donkey.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>We started with an empty DRS, which just became updated after
      (7).</p>
      <p><span class="math display">\[
      \drs{r, x}{\text{RUSSELL}(r)\\ \text{DONKEY}(x) \\ \text{SEE}(r,
      x)}
      \]</span></p>
      <p>With this state in our brains, we then receive the second
      sentence.</p>
      <ol start="8" class="example" type="1">
      <li>He smiled at it.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Now we have two new names, “he” and “it” (both of which are
      anaphora), and one new conditional.</p>
      <p><span class="math display">\[
      \drs{r, x}{\text{RUSSELL}(r)\\ \text{DONKEY}(x) \\ \text{SEE}(r,
      x)}
      \Rightarrow
      \drs{r, x, \hat{y}, \hat{z}}
      {\text{RUSSELL}(r)\\ \text{DONKEY}(x) \\ \text{SEE}(r, x) \\
      \text{SMILE}(\hat{y}, \hat{z})}
      \]</span></p>
      <p>The anaphora <span class="math inline">\(\hat{y}\)</span> and
      <span class="math inline">\(\hat{z}\)</span> at this point are
      incomplete — we need to resolve which antecedent goes with which.
      This is actually trivial in our example. <span
      class="math inline">\(\hat{y}\)</span> can <em>only</em> map to
      <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, and <span
      class="math inline">\(\hat{z}\)</span> to <span
      class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.<a href="#fn6"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
      <p><span class="math display">\[
      \drs{r, x, \hat{y}, \hat{z}}
      {\text{RUSSELL}(r)\\ \text{DONKEY}(x) \\ \text{SEE}(r, x) \\
      \text{SMILE}(\hat{y}, \hat{z})}
      \Rightarrow
      \drs{r, x, \hat{y}, \hat{z}}
      {r = \hat{y} \\ x = \hat{z} \\
      \text{RUSSELL}(r)\\ \text{DONKEY}(x) \\ \text{SEE}(r, x) \\
      \text{SMILE}(\hat{y}, \hat{z})}
      \Rightarrow
      \drs{r, x}
      {\text{RUSSELL}(r)\\ \text{DONKEY}(x) \\ \text{SEE}(r, x) \\
      \text{SMILE}(r, x)}
      \]</span></p>
      <h3 id="some-intuition-on-new-names">Some Intuition on New
      Names</h3>
      <p>So much of this work revolves around rethinking what
      quantifiers mean in a dynamic context. Should we be adding
      discourse referents for every noun we see?</p>
      <p>Probably not. Consider if I said:</p>
      <ol start="9" class="example" type="1">
      <li>Russell loves a donkey. The donkey does not love him
      back.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>When you hear “Russell”, your brain says “ok, we’re talking
      about a guy named Russell”. Then you hear “a donkey” — “ah! A
      donkey has entered the picture”. “The donkey” however, did not add
      a new character to our world. Because it is definite<a href="#fn7"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>, we know not to add a new
      referent. Any time we hear the indefinite “a farmer” or “another
      donkey”, however, we know to add a discourse referent.</p>
      <h3 id="negation-of-drss">Negation of DRSs</h3>
      <p>It turns out global scope isn’t exactly always what you
      want.</p>
      <ol start="10" class="example" type="1">
      <li>#There is <span class="n1">no donkey</span>. Russell smiles at
      <span class="nq">it</span>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><span class="nq">It</span> here certainly can’t refer to <span
      class="n1">no donkey</span>! This negative-quantifier has a very
      narrow scope — you can never refer back to the donkey that doesn’t
      exist. To deal with this, we can nest DRSs!</p>
      <p><span class="math display">\[
      \drs{r, \hat{y}}{
      \text{RUSSELL}(r) \\ \text{SMILE}(r, \hat{y}) \\
      \neg \; \drs{x}{\text{DONKEY}(x)}_{R_1}
      }_{R_0}
      \]</span></p>
      <p>We can read this as <strong>“any extension to <span
      class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> which includes the content of
      <span class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> must be
      false”.</strong></p>
      <h3 id="conditionals">Conditionals</h3>
      <p>So how do we model conditionals with this system?</p>
      <ol start="11" class="example" type="1">
      <li>If <span class="n1">Russell</span> had <span class="n2">a
      donkey</span>, <span class="n1">he</span> would beat <span
      class="n2">it</span>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Again, we’re going to use a method of nested DRSs.</p>
      <p><span class="math display">\[
      \drs{r}{ \text{RUSSELL}(r) \\
      \drs{x}{ \text{DONKEY}(x) \\ \text{HAS}(r,x) }_{R_1} \Rightarrow
      \drs{\hat{y}, \hat{z}}{ \text{BEAT}(\hat{y}, \hat{z}) }_{R_2}
      }_{R_0}
      \]</span></p>
      <p>A lot like negation, <span class="math inline">\(R_1
      \Rightarrow R_2\)</span> is giving us rules about how <span
      class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> might be expanded. Namely,
      <strong>any extension which includes the contents of <span
      class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> must also include the contents
      of <span class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span>.</strong></p>
      <h2 id="dynamic-is-useful">Dynamic is Useful</h2>
      <p>Obviously I’ve only barely introduced DRT<a href="#fn8"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a>, but it might quickly be
      apparent how <em>dynamic semantics</em> can be very powerful. It
      seems to address anaphora fairly well, but that’s really just the
      beginning.</p>
      <p>DRT is also something that can be easily modeled by a computer.
      This has led to a whole swath of fruitful research in AI and
      Computational Linguistics. For the same reason, it also bridges
      formal semantics with psychological models of language.</p>
      <p>What I find particularly interesting, is that dynamic semantics
      also seems to bring the <em>pragmatic-semantic</em> interface more
      into focus. <strong>Pragmatics</strong>, which is loosely the
      subfield of linguistics dealing with how context contributes to
      meaning, has been a rather elusive topic. With a DRS, however, we
      can more clearly see when and how pragmatics jumps into the
      picture — for example, searching for an antecedent <span
      class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to bind to some anaphora <span
      class="math inline">\(\hat{y}\)</span>.</p>
      <h2 id="parting-notes">Parting Notes</h2>
      <p>If you’d like a deeper look at DRT, I’d strongly suggest <span
      class="citation" data-cites="kamp">Kamp, Genabith, and Reyle (<a
      href="#ref-kamp" role="doc-biblioref">2010</a>)</span> and <span
      class="citation" data-cites="stan-drt">Geurts and Maier (<a
      href="#ref-stan-drt" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>,
      probably in that order. They both read very easy, and go much more
      in-depth on the subject.</p>
      <p>I haven’t seen the actual phrase “dynamic scope” used in
      discussion about these theories, but the idea is there. I’m just
      using my computer science vocabulary.</p>
      <p>I actually originally wanted to write exclusively about <span
      class="citation" data-cites="partee">Partee (<a href="#ref-partee"
      role="doc-biblioref">1984</a>)</span>, and her use of DRT for the
      analysis of tense, but… I couldn’t actually find a copy of the
      paper online! The tragic realities of not being affiliated with a
      university… I hope to post a mini-post soon, introducing those
      ideas.</p>
      <p>If I were to write a part-two, I think I’d like to look at
      judgments, inferences, and maybe even a computational
      implementation (this feel like it would be fun to implement in
      Coq, for example). It’s also worth noting that there are a number
      of different <em>flavors</em> of DRT, each with their own pros and
      cons.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned later this week for a spiritual sequel, though! I
      have a fun topic planed related to anaphora.</p>
      <p><strong>Thanks as always for reading!</strong> Every week I
      write about something I’m learning to test my own understanding,
      but also to work on my writing and explanatory skills. If you have
      questions, critiques, or thoughts, please <strong>leave a
      comment!</strong> They might teach me something, and they’ll let
      me know someone’s reading!</p>

      <li id="fn1"><p>Specifically, this is the tradition of Montague
      grammar (which is pretty pervasive). Montague’s thesis is
      essentially that <em>natural languages</em> and <em>formal
      languages</em> (like programming languages) ultimately can be
      treated the same way.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"
      role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn2"><p>This is a bit more clear with a sentence added in
      the middle. e.g. <em>“Russell saw a donkey. In fact, he saw
      hundreds of donkeys. Russell smiled at a donkey”.</em><a
      href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"
      role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn3"><p>This includes sign languages, which I find to be
      objectively cool. Look up some recent work by Philippe Schlenker
      for more information.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back"
      role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn4"><p>If you want a programming example to draw
      intuition from, I would point out <code>bash</code>. In
      <code>bash</code>, all variables are global, and they only come
      into existence when you first assign something to them.<a
      href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back"
      role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn5"><p>This is actually essentially the same of
      converting to logical notation, but now we keep a dynamic list of
      names.<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back"
      role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn6"><p>This is because the syntax of “he” requires a
      male.<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back"
      role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn7"><p>Definite here means “there is only one”. By saying
      “the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>”, you are stating that
      there is only one <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Pronouns
      are another form of definite references.<a href="#fnref7"
      class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
      <li id="fn8"><p><strong>Question for my readers:</strong> have my
      posts been too “introductory”? Would a deep-dive into topics be
      more interesting than a brief overview? Because I haven’t been
      writing much about novel work, I’ve been under the assumption that
      those who wish to learn more will read the source research. There
      are a number of extensions to DRT, critiques, and we haven’t
      touched at all on judgments within the system, or computational
      implementations.<a href="#fnref8" class="footnote-back"
      role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
