    <article>
      <p>Most of us have this intuitive idea that <strong>two equal
      things can substitute each other without consequence.</strong><a
      href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> To show what I mean, consider
      Vladimir Ulyanov, better known to the word simply as “Lenin”.</p>
      <ol class="example" type="1">
      <li><span class="t rf">true</span> Vladimir Ulyanov = Lenin.</li>
      <li><span class="t rf">true</span> <strong>Ulyanov</strong> [ was
      the first Premier of the Soviet Union ].</li>
      <li><span class="t rf">true</span> <strong>Lenin</strong> [ was
      the first Premier of the Soviet Union ].</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Ulyanov and Lenin are the same person, therefore I can always
      swap them out. And actually, we just found a new “name” for Lenin
      — <em>“the first Premier of the Soviet Union”.</em></p>
      <ol start="4" class="example" type="1">
      <li><span class="t rf">true</span> <strong>Lenin</strong> [
      founded Iskra ].</li>
      <li><span class="t rf">true</span> <strong>The first Premier of
      the Soviet Union</strong> [ founded Iskra ].</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Of course, Lenin might not have been the leader he was —
      perhaps Julius Martov could have become the leader of the
      Soviets.</p>
      <ol start="6" class="example" type="1">
      <li><span class="t rf">true</span> Ulyanov might not have been the
      first Premier of the Soviet Union.</li>
      <li><span class="f rf">false</span> Ulyanov might not have been
      Ulyanov.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Awesome… we broke it…</p>
      <p>In this post, let’s look at exactly how (7) just broke; was
      “the first Premier” just a bad name, or do our problems go deeper?
      It might seem like a pedantic question, but if we want to
      understand or model language, equality would be a pretty important
      thing to nail down!</p>
      <h2 id="references">References</h2>
      <p>The technical term we’re discussing is <a
      href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reference/"><strong>reference</strong></a>
      — a word (or words) that “point” to something (if you have a CS
      background, your intuitions might be useful here). Broadly
      speaking we could break references into two categories:
      <strong>names</strong> and <strong>descriptions</strong>.</p>
      <div class="multicol">
      <div>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Names</strong>
      <ul>
      <li>Names, in general, are single lexical items.</li>
      <li>e.g. <em>“Tyler Cecil”</em> refers to a (rather hansom)
      individual.</li>
      <li>e.g. <em>“You”</em> refers to another attractive individual
      (though it requires context to know which).</li>
      </ul></li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>(Definite) Descriptions</strong>
      <ul>
      <li>A definite description is a description quantified by “the”
      (meaning there is only one).</li>
      <li>e.g. <em>“The number of states in the USA”</em> refers to the
      number 50 (and no other number).</li>
      <li>e.g. <em>“The Shinings’s director”</em> refers to Stanley
      Kubrick.</li>
      </ul></li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p>The important note here is that <strong>references are not the
      things themselves</strong>. If the word “rose” were a rose, then a
      rose by any other name would not be a rose. And that’s the root of
      our problems — the space between our words, and the world we’re
      describing.</p>
      <p>Linguists, philosophers, and logicians have had a knot in their
      stomachs about reference for ages, but their conversations are not
      always the most accessible. It doesn’t need to be that way,
      though; a few good examples can demonstrate just how sticky the
      topic is, and I think <span class="citation"
      data-cites="quine">Quine (<a href="#ref-quine"
      role="doc-biblioref">1956</a>)</span> did a great job providing
      some.</p>
      <p>He breaks down the usage of references into two categories:
      well behaved <strong>transparent references</strong>, and the more
      problematic <strong>opaque references</strong>.</p>
      <div class="multicol">
      <div>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Transparent References</strong>
      <ul>
      <li>Seem to allow for substitution of “equal” references.</li>
      <li>Are simple to model logically.</li>
      <li>Don’t tend to be ambiguous.</li>
      <li>e.g. <em>“The first odd prime plus 2 is 5”.</em> This sentence
      can easily be re-written using any other reference for 3.</li>
      </ul></li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Opaque References</strong>
      <ul>
      <li>Do not always allow substitution of “equal” references.</li>
      <li>Not obvious how to model logically.</li>
      <li>Can often be ambiguous.</li>
      <li>e.g. <em>“He thinks the first odd prime is 5”.</em> Rewriting
      this sentence with some other reference for 3 wouldn’t have the
      same meaning.</li>
      </ul></li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p>So, <em>when do opaque references occure?</em></p>
      <h3 id="modal">Modal</h3>
      <p>Sentences with worlds like “must”, “may”, “could”, and “might”
      are called <em>modal sentences</em>. The modern way to think about
      modality is with two operators: necessity, and possibility.<a
      href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
      <dl>
      <dt>Necessity <span class="math inline">\(\square P\)</span></dt>
      <dd>
      In all possible words, <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> must
      be true.
      </dd>
      <dt>Possibility <span class="math inline">\(\lozenge
      P\)</span></dt>
      <dd>
      There exists a word in which <span
      class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is true.
      </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>We actually already saw an example of a modal reference with
      (7), and could express it using “<span
      class="math inline">\(\lozenge\)</span>”.</p>
      <p><span class="math display">\[
      \begin{align*}
        &amp;\text{Ulyanov} = \text{First Premier}               &amp;
      \text{true}\\
        \lozenge &amp; \text{Ulyanov} \not= \text{First Premier} &amp;
      \text{true}\\
        \lozenge &amp; \text{Ulyanov} \not= \text{Ulynov}        &amp;
      \text{false}\\
      \end{align*}
      \]</span></p>
      <p>Written out explicitly like this, it’s more clear exactly how
      (7) failed. References seem to operate slightly differently within
      the scope of “<span class="math inline">\(\lozenge\)</span>”.<a
      href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
      <p>Here’s another example, this time using necessity:</p>
      <ol start="8" class="example" type="1">
      <li><span class="t rf">true</span> The number of English letters
      is 26.</li>
      <li><span class="t rf">true</span> Necessarily 26 should be
      26.</li>
      <li><span class="f rf">false</span> Necessarily the number of
      English letters should be 26.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Now, written with our <span
      class="math inline">\(\square\)</span> operator:</p>
      <p><span class="math display">\[
      \begin{align*}
        n \, \text{letters}        &amp;= 26 &amp;\text{true}\\
        \square 26                 &amp;= 26 &amp;\text{true}\\
        \square n \,\text{letters} &amp;= 26 &amp;\text{false}
      \end{align*}
      \]</span></p>
      <p>Again we see that “the number of English letters” under the
      scope of “<span class="math inline">\(\square\)</span>” can refer
      to different numbers, whereas the name “26”, in all possible
      words, can only refer to the number 26.</p>
      <h3 id="propositional-attitudes">Propositional Attitudes</h3>
      <p>Propositional attitudes get at the relationship between some
      proposition <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> and another
      person. For example:</p>
      <ol start="11" class="example" type="1">
      <li>Li Na <strong>claims</strong> [ she doesn’t know him ].</li>
      <li>Dolores <strong>believes</strong> [ they are seeing each other
      ].</li>
      <li>He <strong>hopes</strong> [ they will get a divorce ].</li>
      </ol>
      <p>None of these sentences say that the proposition in brackets is
      true or false — they only say what the members of this love
      triangle <em>say, think, and want</em>.</p>
      <p>Right off the bat, we can see how such sentences have an issue
      with references:</p>
      <ol start="14" class="example" type="1">
      <li><span class="t rf">true</span> Jozefína <em>thinks</em> the
      number of English letters is 46.<a href="#fn4"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></li>
      <li><span class="f rf">false</span> Jozefína <em>thinks</em> 26 is
      46.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In (14), Jozefína simply doesn’t know how may letters English
      speakers use. That certainly doesn’t imply that she is totally
      ignorant of numbers!</p>
      <h4 id="names-fails-as-well">Names Fails As Well</h4>
      <p>Propositional attitudes work just as bad with names as they do
      with definite descriptions. Consider Omar, who has a test in his
      Russian history class. He knows there will be an essay question,
      and he hopes it will be about Lenin. He does not know, however,
      that Lenin’s birth name was Ulyanov.</p>
      <ol start="16" class="example" type="1">
      <li><span class="t rf">true</span> Omar hopes he will write about
      Lenin.</li>
      <li><span class="q rf">???</span> Omar hopes he will write about
      Ulyanov.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>(17) is not true, in the sense that, when Omar sees an essay
      question about Ulyanov, he will probably panic, walk out of the
      room, and change majors.</p>
      <p>It gets more complicated, though. Let’s say Omar’s parents
      (both history professors) are talking over breakfast. Omar’s
      mother says “Omar hopes the essay is about Ulyanov”. Omar’s
      father, knowing who Ulyanov is, would declare this sentence to be
      true!</p>
      <h4 id="not-just-noun-phrases">Not Just Noun-Phrases</h4>
      <p>Everything we’ve done so far has been a noun-phrase, but
      consider my baby cousin Grace, age two.</p>
      <ol start="18" class="example" type="1">
      <li><span class="t rf">true</span> Grace knows people have two
      legs.</li>
      <li><span class="t rf">true</span> “Being bipedal” means “having
      two legs”.</li>
      <li><span class="q rf">???</span> Grace knows people are
      bipedal.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Grace may know people have two legs, so in some sense (20) is a
      true statements. That being said, grace is a smart kid, but I
      wouldn’t put a lot of money on her coming up to me any time soon
      and saying “people are bipedal”. So, in another sense, (20) is
      false.</p>
      <h2 id="possible-worlds">Possible Worlds</h2>
      <p>Quine didn’t have the tools he needed to understand these
      sentences, but we’re a luckier bunch. Here’s my claim about the
      difference between transparent and opaque references:</p>
      <table>
      <tbody>
      <tr class="odd">
      <td><strong>Transparent:</strong></td>
      <td style="text-align: left;">Talk about how the actual world
      <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> is.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="even">
      <td><strong>Opaque:</strong></td>
      <td style="text-align: left;">Talk about how some other worlds
      <span class="math inline">\(W&#39; \subseteq W\)</span> are.</td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>That might be a little abstract, so here are some examples of
      what I mean:</p>
      <table>
      <caption>Here “<span class="math inline">\(P @ w\)</span>” simply
      means “<span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is true in world
      <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>”.</caption>
      <tbody>
      <tr class="odd">
      <td style="text-align: left;"><strong><span
      class="math inline">\(P\)</span> must be</strong></td>
      <td style="text-align: left;">In all worlds <span
      class="math inline">\(w \in W\)</span>, <span
      class="math inline">\(P @ w\)</span> is true.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="even">
      <td style="text-align: left;"><strong><span
      class="math inline">\(P\)</span> might be</strong></td>
      <td style="text-align: left;">There is a world <span
      class="math inline">\(w \in W\)</span> where <span
      class="math inline">\(P @ w\)</span> is true.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="odd">
      <td style="text-align: left;"><strong>She thinks <span
      class="math inline">\(P\)</span></strong></td>
      <td style="text-align: left;">She believes in a world <span
      class="math inline">\(w\)</span> where <span
      class="math inline">\(P @ w\)</span> is true.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="even">
      <td style="text-align: left;"><strong>He wants <span
      class="math inline">\(P\)</span></strong></td>
      <td style="text-align: left;">He wants to be in any world <span

      </tr>

      </tr>
      </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>Once we make this revelation, it starts to become clear what
      was happening all along: <strong>references resolve within the
      context of a particular world <span
      class="math inline">\(w\)</span></strong>, and that world is not
      always the one in which we are living; it can be the one about
      which we are speaking.</p>
      <h2 id="a-computational-connection">A Computational
      Connection</h2>
      <p>References are essentially a kind of program — call it
      <code>ref</code>. If I say the name “Le Guin”, I’m asking you the
      listener to bring to mind the person who has that name.
      <code>(ref "Le Guin")</code>. Similarly, if I say “the author of
      <em>The Dispossessed”</em>, I’m asking you to bring to mind the
      person who fits that description.
      <code>(ref "The author of The Dispossessed")</code>. I can only
      assume that, in your mind, those should be the same
      individuals.</p>
      <p><strong>But the result depends which “machine” runs
      <code>ref</code>!</strong> Remember Jozefína?</p>

      English letters is 26”, there are two interpretations</p>
      <div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
      class="sourceCode lisp"><code class="sourceCode commonlisp"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">;; De Re Interpretation</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">;; (no normal speaker would parse this way).</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>(<span class="kw">eq</span> (eval-jozefína (ref <span class="st">&quot;English Letters&quot;</span>) <span class="dv">26</span>)</span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">;; De Dicto Interpretation</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co">;; (the intended meaning).</span></span>
<span id="cb2-6"><a href="#cb2-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>(<span class="kw">eq</span> (eval-jozefína &#39;(ref <span class="st">&quot;English Letters&quot;</span>) <span class="dv">26</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
      <p><strong>De dicto</strong> literally means “about words”, so a
      de dicto reading means “this person thinks/wants/believes
      <em>these exact words</em>”.</p>
      <p><strong>De re</strong> means “about the thing”, so a de re
      reading would be “this person thinks/wants/believes <em>the things
      these words mean</em>”.</p>
      <h2 id="scope-is-always-tricky">Scope Is Always Tricky</h2>
      <p>Natural language, unlike Lisp, doesn’t have clear scope rules.
      If I say “all students talked about a move”, you could take that
      in one of two different ways:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><span class="math inline">\(\forall k\)</span>, <span
      class="math inline">\(\exists m\)</span>, <span
      class="math inline">\(k\)</span> talked about <span
      class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. (Each kid talked about a
      movie.)</li>
      <li><span class="math inline">\(\exists m\)</span>, <span
      class="math inline">\(\forall k\)</span>, <span
      class="math inline">\(k\)</span> talked about <span
      class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. (There is a movie that all kids
      talked about.)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The way we manage this kind of ambiguity is ultimately a
      question of psychology — it’s contextual<a href="#fn5"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. And, as we’ve described it,
      we’ve made <strong>reference a problem of scope
      ambiguity</strong>. When you hear a reference, you mind must
      decided, “was that reference de dicto, or de re?” For example:</p>
      <ol start="21" class="example" type="1">
      <li>Gloria thinks someone here is a murderer.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>When you hear this sentence, there are two totally legitimate
      ways to interpret it.</p>
      <div class="multicol">
      <div>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>De Dicto:</strong>
      <ul>
      <li>Gloria thinks that, among the people here, one of them must be
      a murderer.</li>
      <li>Here Gloria thinks <em>the words</em> “someone here is a
      murderer”.</li>
      </ul></li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>De Re:</strong>
      <ul>
      <li>There is a person here, and Gloria thinks they are a
      murderer.</li>
      <li>Here the speaker is saying “someone” to the listener, to
      describe what Gloria thinks.</li>
      </ul></li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p>Let’s drive this home with one last example. Consider Antonio
      and Yolanda, who are visiting an art show. Yolanda points to one
      painting in particular, and says:</p>
      <ol start="22" class="example" type="1">
      <li>That painter is amazing!</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Later that night, Antonio says to his sister:</p>
      <ol start="23" class="example" type="1">
      <li>Yolanda thinks the girl down the street is an amazing
      painter.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Antonio “translated” the reference <em>“that painter”</em>
      (which Antonio’s sister wouldn’t understand) to <em>“the girl down
      the street”</em> (which Yolanda wouldn’t understand). Antonio’s
      sister hears the sentence as:</p>
      <div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre
      class="sourceCode lisp"><code class="sourceCode commonlisp"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>(think yolanda (is (ref <span class="st">&quot;the girl down the street&quot;</span>) amazing-painter))</span></code></pre></div>
      <p>And because Yolanda doesn’t know who the girl down the street
      is, she would not likely think:<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a><a href="#fn7"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
      <div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre
      class="sourceCode lisp"><code class="sourceCode commonlisp"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>(think yolanda &#39;(is (ref <span class="st">&quot;the girl down the street&quot;</span>) amazing-painter))</span></code></pre></div>
      <p>We could also think back to (17) — the de dicto reading is
      false, because Omar didn’t know who Ulyanov was. However, when his
      mother made the same statement to a different audience, it was
      received with a de re meaning, and was therefore true.</p>

      <p>I hope you enjoyed following along with me on my topic of the
      week. Referential Opacity can seem a little abstract; historically
      the main problem had always been that modeling language would
      never be possible without understanding reference. <span
      class="citation" data-cites="quine">Quine (<a href="#ref-quine"
      role="doc-biblioref">1956</a>)</span> is a remarkably entertaining
      paper, and I would highly recommend it (it’s a short read, full of
      great examples)! It and <span class="citation"
      data-cites="partee">Hall-Partee (<a href="#ref-partee"
      role="doc-biblioref">1979</a>)</span> do a good job laying out why
      the problem matters.</p>
      <p>One critical piece of required reading here that has been left
      unmentioned is <span class="citation" data-cites="kripke">Kripke
      (<a href="#ref-kripke" role="doc-biblioref">1980</a>)</span> —
      <em>“Naming and Necessity”</em> is <em>the</em> book on reference,
      which servers as the modern foundation of the problem in
      Philosophy, Language, Logic, and anyone else who may be
      interested. Before Kripke, this was considered a massive open
      problem. It’s considered to be required reading in these fields.
      The computation connections are my own intuition, but they largely
      shadow the thinking of Sual Kripke.</p>
