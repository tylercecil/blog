        <div class="note">
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> I’ve been on a bit of a hiatus, but it’s
      important to me that I get back to writing! This post is a bit
      less polished than I’d like, but it’s short, which I think is a
      good way to keep me writing on a regular schedule.</p>
    </div>
    
    <article>
      <p>The expert steps in, and gives an assessment of the
      situation:</p>
      <ol class="example" type="1">
      <li>“They might have survived”, they explain.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Now tell me, with what little context you have, how do
      <em>you</em> read (1)? <em>Did</em> they die? <em>Could</em> they
      still be out there? Was there something we could have done to save
      them?</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>If you assumed they died, you are a pessimist, and likely a
      drain on the people around you. If you assumed they lived, you’re
      wrong — they were all eaten alive by lions.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Today’s very short post is about the <strong>semantics of
      modality.</strong> Really though, it’s just an excuse for me to
      share some amusing sentences, focused around usage of the English
      words <em>may</em> and <em>might</em>; two words, I would venture,
      that the average native English speaker has trouble defining, and,
      in fact, whose meanings appear to be changing in modern English.
      <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
      <h2 id="modality">Modality</h2>
      <p>First, what exactly was the ambiguity in (1)?</p>
      <ol start="2" class="example" type="1">
      <li>“They might have survived if the lions hadn’t found
      them.”</li>
      <li>“They might have survived — we haven’t found any bodies.”</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In (2), it is clear that our heros met an unsavory end.
      However, (3) is markedly more positive, expressing uncertainty
      about their fate. In both cases, though, <strong>the expert did
      not say they necessarily survived.</strong> So then, how do we
      model these logically?</p>
      <p>To answer that, we need to understand <em>logical
      modality</em>. I’ve actually <a
      href="/posts/2020/02/13/reference.html#modal">written about
      modality before</a>, but let’s recap.</p>
      <p>There are things in this world that are true, like <em>“stop
      signs are red”</em>. There are also things, however, that
      <em>could</em> be true, like <em>“stop signs could be
      blue”</em>.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> There are even things that
      <em>must</em> be true, like <em>“stop signs must have been
      invented by someone”</em>.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
      id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a><a href="#fn4"
      class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
      <p>In English, sentences with words like <em>shall, should, can,
      could, may, might, would</em>, or <em>must</em> (as well as some
      other words and constructs) express <em>modality</em>. In the
      simplest case, modality is logically represented with two
      operators:</p>
      <dl>
      <dt>Necessity: <span class="math inline">\(\square P\)</span></dt>
      <dd>
      <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> <em>must</em> be
      true.<br />
      i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\square
      \text{SURVIVE}(\text{they})\)</span> could model <em>“they must
      have survived”</em>.
      </dd>
      <dt>Possibility: <span class="math inline">\(\lozenge
      P\)</span></dt>
      <dd>
      <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is possibly true.<br />
      i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\lozenge
      \text{SURVIVE}(\text{they})\)</span> could mode <em>“it is
      possible they survived”</em>.
      </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Both of these are subtly different than claiming some <span
      class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is true. This gets especially
      tricky with necessity — is there a difference between saying
      something <em>must be</em> true, and something <em>is</em> true?
      What’s more, while this is all well and good for (3), it’s not
      exactly clear how this can be used to model (2). It’s worth us
      diving into exactly how <span
      class="math inline">\(\square\)</span> and <span
      class="math inline">\(\lozenge\)</span> work.</p>
      <h3 id="possible-worlds">Possible Worlds</h3>
      <p>I need you to do a favor for me, and picture the set of all
      possible worlds.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>That wasn’t so hard, was it?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Let’s call this set <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>.
      With this new friend of ours, we can break down our two new
      operators.</p>
      <dl>
      <dt>Necessity: <span class="math inline">\(\square P\)</span></dt>
      <dd>
      <span class="math inline">\(\forall w \in W,\; P @
      w\)</span><br />
      <em>For all worlds in <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>,
      <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is true in that world.</em>
      </dd>
      <dt>Possibility: <span class="math inline">\(\lozenge
      P\)</span></dt>
      <dd>
      <span class="math inline">\(\exists w \in W,\; P @
      w\)</span><br />
      <em>There exists a world <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> in
      the set of all worlds <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>, such
      that <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is true in that world
      <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>.</em>
      </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>The real magic here is this <span
      class="math inline">\(@\)</span> operator, which allows us to
      express that <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is true in
      some world. That world might be a world someone believes in
      (<em>“Li believes she knows the answer”</em>), worlds across time
      (<em>“it has always been true”</em>), or all logically conceivable
      worlds (<em>“no matter what, 1 + 1 must be 2!”</em>).</p>
      <p>Modality is more than just possibility and necessity;
      <strong>modality allows us to talk about the worlds where
      propositions are true, and not just the propositions
      themselves.</strong></p>
      <h3 id="types-of-modality">Types of Modality</h3>
      <p>“The set of all worlds” is kinda a tricky idea, of course. In
      fact, there are a number of various <em>types</em> of modality,
      each corresponding to a different set of worlds. Here are the most
      commonly discussed:</p>
      <h4 id="logical-modality">Logical Modality</h4>
      <p>Logical modality deals with the set of all logically consistent
      worlds, and is one of the strongest / most general modalities.</p>
      <table>
      <tbody>
      <tr class="odd">
      <td><strong>Possibility</strong></td>
      <td style="text-align: left;"><em>“The first prime can not be
      4!”</em></td>
      <td><span class="math inline">\(\neg\lozenge_L\)</span>first prime
      is 4</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="even">
      <td><strong>Necessity</strong></td>
      <td style="text-align: left;"><em>“There must be infinite
      primes!”</em></td>
      <td><span class="math inline">\(\square_L\)</span>there are
      infinite primes</td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
      </table>
      <h4 id="epistemic-modality">Epistemic Modality</h4>
      <p>Epistemic modality deals with a smaller set of worlds — only
      those worlds consistent with what the speaker knows. This is the
      “as-far-as-I-know” set. For example, I might know someone has been
      stealing cookies, based on the state of the cookie jar. It is not
      <em>logically necessary</em> that someone is stealing cookies, but
      with the evidence at hand… there must be a cookie-thief among
      us.</p>
      <table>
      <tbody>
      <tr class="odd">
      <td><strong>Possibility</strong></td>
      <td><em>“It’s possible he was at the party.”</em></td>
      <td style="text-align: left;"><span
      class="math inline">\(\lozenge_E\)</span>he was at party</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="even">
      <td><strong>Necessity</strong></td>
      <td><em>“The gods must be crazy!”</em></td>
      <td style="text-align: left;"><span
      class="math inline">\(\square_E\)</span>gods are crazy</td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>In “the gods must be crazy”, the meaning here is not that
      “logically speaking, if there are gods, they must be crazy, in all
      possible words”. Instead, it’s making a statement about a
      conclusion the speaker has come to. The speaker has looked around
      them and said “I don’t know everything about this world, but all
      signs point towards some bonkers gods”.</p>
      <h4 id="deontic-modality">Deontic Modality</h4>
      <p>Deontic modality is substantially different than the others<a
      href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. The set of worlds being
      described here are the worlds which are being declared “allowed”.
      I think an example could show this best:</p>
      <table>
      <tbody>
      <tr class="odd">
      <td><strong>Possibility</strong></td>
      <td style="text-align: left;"><em>“You may have one more
      slice”</em></td>
      <td><span class="math inline">\(\lozenge_D\)</span>you have one
      more slice</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="even">
      <td><strong>Necessity</strong></td>
      <td style="text-align: left;"><em>“you must come home”</em></td>
      <td><span class="math inline">\(\square_D\)</span>you come
      home</td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>In this case, the speaker isn’t so much declaring conclusions
      about worlds, but giving commands of a sort.</p>
      <h2 id="might-and-may">Might and May</h2>
      <p>Writing a little intro on modality, however, was really only an
      excuse to get to a set of sentences I found to be mildly
      interesting. They come down to this question: <strong>what is the
      difference between “may” and “might”?</strong></p>
      <p>At first glance, they are almost interchangeable (both express
      <span class="math inline">\(\lozenge\)</span>, modal possibility).
      On closer observation, however, each word is used with a different
      set of modes.</p>
      <table>
      <thead>
      <tr class="header">
      <th style="text-align: right;">Mode Type</th>
      <th style="text-align: left;">May</th>
      <th style="text-align: left;">Might</th>
      </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
      <tr class="odd">
      <td style="text-align: right;"><strong>Logical
      Possibility</strong></td>
      <td style="text-align: left;"><span class="bad">Not
      Used</span></td>
      <td style="text-align: left;"><span class="good">Used</span></td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="even">
      <td style="text-align: right;"><strong>Epistemic
      Possibility</strong></td>
      <td style="text-align: left;"><span class="good">Used</span></td>
      <td style="text-align: left;"><span class="good">Used</span></td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="odd">
      <td style="text-align: right;"><strong>Deontic
      Possibility</strong></td>
      <td style="text-align: left;"><span class="good">Used</span></td>
      <td style="text-align: left;"><span class="meh">Not Used</span><a
      href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
      role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></td>
      </tr>
      </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>Now you shouldn’t just take my word for that. Instead, read
      these example sentences taken from <span class="citation"
      data-cites="kearns2011">Kearns (<a href="#ref-kearns2011"
      role="doc-biblioref">2011, 81</a>)</span>, and see if you agree
      with the judgments.</p>
      <div class="example">
      <p><strong>Logical Possibility</strong></p>
      <ol type="a">
      <li><span class="good">She <strong><em>might</em></strong> have
      fallen down the cliff — thank goodness the safety harness
      held.</span></li>
      <li><span class="bad">#She <strong><em>may</em></strong> have
      fallen down the cliff — thank goodness the safety harness
      held.</span></li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Epistemic Possibility</strong></p>
      <ol type="a">
      <li><span class="good">She <strong><em>may</em></strong> have
      fallen down the cliff — we’re still waiting for the rescue team’s
      report.</span></li>
      <li><span class="good">She <strong><em>might</em></strong> have
      fallen down the cliff — we’re still waiting for the rescue team’s
      report.</span></li>
      </ol>
      </div>
      <p>Interesting, no? <span class="citation"
      data-cites="kearns2011">Kearns (<a href="#ref-kearns2011"
      role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span> claims that this difference
      seems to be disappearing in modern English. I haven’t been able to
      find research supporting that claim, but I’ve been thinking about
      how I might test it. If I find the time, I’d be interested in
      doing a little follow up work.</p>
      <p>If these judgments don’t line up with your own, I’d love to
      hear more from you! Or if you could point me to some research on
      this possible semantic drift in English, that would be just as
      helpful!</p>

      One uses it with the intention of eliciting a behavior from
      others. The categorization of a “speech act” is known as
      <strong>illocutionary force</strong>. Speech acts are a pretty
      fascinating topic that should probably be looked into more often
