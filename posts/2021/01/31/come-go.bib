  abstract = {In linguistics, deixis () is the use of general words and phrases to refer to a specific time, place, or person in context, e.g., the words tomorrow, there, and they. Words are deictic if their semantic meaning is fixed but their denoted meaning varies depending on time and/or place. Words or phrases that require contextual information to be fully understood—for example, English pronouns—are deictic. Deixis is closely related to anaphora. Although this article deals primarily with deixis in spoken language, the concept is sometimes applied to written language, gestures, and communication media as well. In linguistic anthropology, deixis is treated as a particular subclass of the more general semiotic phenomenon of indexicality, a sign "pointing to" some aspect of its context of occurrence. Although this article draws examples primarily from English, deixis is believed to be a feature (to some degree) of all natural languages. The term's origin is Ancient Greek: δεῖξις, romanized: deixis, lit. 'display, demonstration, or reference', the meaning point of reference in contemporary linguistics having been taken over from Chrysippus.},

  abstract = {This ERP study explores how participants activate their own geographical perspective, while reading sentences describing a motion (to come or to go), or a static spatial relation (to be) referred either to the participant׳s current location or a distant place. The ERPs recorded at the place names revealed that, compared to “distant places”, “close places” enhanced ERP׳s components, associated with motivational relevance, in the context of the deictic verbs of motion to come and to go, but not in the context of the static verb to be. Also, in the context of the verbs of motion source estimation showed that “close places” elicited more activity than “distant places” in the medial temporal cortex (around the parahippocampal gyrus), suggesting projection of the reader׳s self-relevant information, or retrieval of geographical episodic memories. Finally, sentences describing motions congruent with the self-perspective (e.g. “going to distant place”) elicited less activation than sentences incongruent with the self-perspective (e.g. “coming to distant place”) in the right fronto-polar cortex and in the posterior cingulate cortex, regions generally associated with the other׳s perspective or with self/other perspective conflict. These findings provide information on the brain processes underlying readers׳ perspective taking, guided by the deictic verbs of motion.},

In Study 1, most participants spontaneously produced deictic terms, often in conjunction with pointing. Yet only among children with autism were there participants who referred to a location that was distal to themselves with the terms ‘this’ or ‘here’, or made atypical points with unusual precision, often lining-up with an eye. In Study 2, participants with autism were less accurate in responding to instructions involving contrastive deictic terms, and fewer responded accurately to indicative head nods.},

  abstract = {By focusing on a wayfinding discussion by Japaneserock climbers, this case study shows that even a short segment of discourse can sufficiently embed several layers of "denotational" and "interactional" texts (Silverstein 1997) that emerge through discursive interactions. On the denotational level, there appearsto be a highly consistent pattern in which iku'go'tokens are used in the earlier phase of the segmentand kuru'come' tokens are used in the latter, with both tokens highly systematically distributed and aligned through the conceptual "equivalence" (Jakobson 1960) of deictic tokens. This pattern also evokes and resonates with the interactional text, which has been indexically constructed by the manipulation of the time-space deixis. I show that social configurations can be tacitly and immanently createdwith these deictic tokens in interaction, and I stress the importance of studying the sequential vicissitudesof penpectival maintenanceand shifts in discourse.},

The production data indicate that (1) age of acquisition of these verbs is considerably younger than previously reported, (2) bring and take are acquired later than the come/go pair, and (3) acquisition of these verbs involves mapping the appropriate words onto preconceived features of situations, rather than the abstraction of the semantic features underlying each verb.},
